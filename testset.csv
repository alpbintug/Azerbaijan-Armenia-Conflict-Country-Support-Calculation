BG;2,300 Armenian Soldiers Killed, Wounded in Clashes, Claims Azerbaijani Defence Ministry;"Over 2,300 Armenian servicemen were killed and wounded in the continuing clashes in Nagorno-Karabakh, Azerbaijani defence ministry claimed on Wednesday.""From September 27 and up to this morning, around 2,300 enemy fighters were eliminated and wounded: around 130 tanks and other armoured vehicles, over 200 artillery, missile and mortar launchers, around 25 air defense weapons: six command and control and observation posts: five ammunition depots: around 50 armour-defeating weapons, and 55 automobiles were eliminated and brought out of action,"" the Defence Ministry told Sputnik. On Sunday morning, an escalation unfolded along the contact line of Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian-majority autonomy that proclaimed independence from what then was the Soviet Azerbaijan Republic in 1991.Azerbaijan launched what it described as a ""counteroffensive,"" while the Artsakh authorities accused Azerbaijani forces of opening fire against civilians and civilian infrastructure in its capital of Stepanakert.The armed hostilities continue at this point.";E
RU;‘Everything is destroyed again’: Armenian refugee family shares story with RT in aftermath of new Nagorno-Karabakh war;The war in Nagorno-Karabakh has sent tens of thousands of ethnic Armenians fleeing from the hostilities – and a peace deal, perceived by many as Armenia’s surrender, has left little hope of return, a family of refugees told RT.Some 90,000 civilians have fled Nagorno-Karabakh over the past few weeks as the forces of the breakaway region, supported by Armenia, clashed with Azerbaijani military troops.The self-proclaimed republic broke away from Azerbaijan back in the 1990s. The region, populated predominantly by ethnic Armenians, lived in the legal gray zone – and relative peace – for some 30 years, until the new war broke out late in September.“We’ve built our dreams, we’ve wanted our dreams to come true. But after 30 years, it’s war again. Again, everything is destroyed,” Nanar Eremyan, who fled the region’s capital Stepanakert, told RT.While Eremyan did not initially intend to leave her home behind, she said she had to do so for the sake of her children, as Stepanakert has been repeatedly subjected to shelling and bombardment. Eremyan fled to Armenia’s capital, Yerevan – and she and other refugees have received a very warm welcome from the locals.In addition to refugee shelters and charities, private Armenian citizens sought to help the refugees. Nanar’s family, for instance, has been sheltered by a local woman.“I thought something needs to be done and I’ve started looking for a family to help. They’ve found me, and I’ve found them. They’ve been living with me since October 1,” the woman told RT.The peace deal reached by Armenia and Azerbaijan this week did not bring much relief to the refugees. The agreement has been largely perceived as a surrender by Armenians and triggered mass protests across the country.The deal has returned many Nagorno-Karabakh settlements to Azerbaijan’s control – and that news alone has triggered a new wave of refugees. Nanar believes Baku will never allow them to coexist peacefully, and that many ethnic Armenians will never be able to return home to Nagorno-Karabakh.;E
RU;‘Nikol is a traitor’: Armenian opposition parties lead protest in crisis-hit Yerevan, demand resignation of PM Pashinyan;Over a thousand protesters have gathered in Yerevan to demand the resignation of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan following the Nagorno-Karabakh peace deal. They are accusing him of being a traitor for signing a truce with Baku.In the early hours of Tuesday morning, Pashinyan announced that the country had agreed to end hostilities with Azerbaijan, following a bloody conflict which began in late September. After repeatedly claiming that Armenia was winning the war, he is now coming under attack for what many locals see as a surrender.On Wednesday afternoon, demonstrators met in the center of Yerevan, chanting “Nikol is a traitor.” Led by politicians from a wide range of opposition parties, the protest has brought together Armenians who disagree with the government's decision to end the conflict. Eyewitness reports suggest that the police have arrested individual protest leaders, but the participants have continued undeterred. MP Gagik Tsarukyan, the head of Prosperous Armenia, the country's second-biggest party, was detained by law enforcement.Earlier this week, the leaders of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Russia signed a joint statement agreeing to a truce in Nagorno-Karabakh. The agreement states that Azerbaijani and Armenian troops must remain in their current positions, an arrangement which is to be enforced by Russian peacekeepers. This means that Baku will keep the areas of Nagorno-Karabakh it regained control of during the conflict. According to Pashinyan, Yerevan had no choice, as the country's resources were quickly becoming depleted.On September 27, the frozen conflict suddenly erupted once again. The dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia is decades old, with both countries believing they have legitimate claims to the territory. The region is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan but is primarily populated by ethnic Armenians. Baku had always considered the enclave to be illegally occupied by Yerevan.;E
RU;ADDRESS by the Ambassador of the Russian Federation to Ireland Yuriy Filatov to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence December 17, 2020;The recent settlement of the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh could be considered as an example of the above-mentioned approach. The November 9 agreement reached by the leaders of Russia, Azerbaijan and Armenia stopped the bloodshed and paved the way for a long-term settlement. Due to the Agreement, thousands of internally displaced persons and refugees have returned to their households and secured conditions for the process of rebuilding of the economy and solution of the humanitarian problems. Now we can create real conditions to turn the region of the Southern Caucasus from the instability and internal tense contradictions into the place of stability and flourishing in the interests of all peoples living there and Russia will continue persistently support an advancement in this direction.;N
SE;Agreement finalised on Nagorno-Karabakh;"Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia have signed an agreement to end fighting over the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh.This is stated by both The Prime Minister of Armenia, Nikol Pasjinjan, and Russian President Vladimir Putin.Pasjinjan writes in a message on Facebook that the agreement is ""extremely painful for me personally and for our people"" but that the decision was made after an analysis of the current state of the ongoing fighting and that ""this is the best solution"".Just an hour after the agreement was signed, thousands of demonstrators gathered outside the headquarters of the Armenian Government in the capital Yerevan. Eyewitnesses tell the AFP news agency that a few hundred of them stormed the government building, shattered windows and destroyed several offices.Russian peace forcesThe agreement entered into force after midnight the night of Tuesday local time. According to Putin – whose Russia has a military pact with Armenia – the new agreement represents a total ceasefire in the disputed region.The agreement, if it is held, would put an end to a six-week armed conflict. Between 1 000 and 1 200 people have been confirmed dead as a result of the conflict, but the number of casualties is believed to be higher.The Russian Defense Ministry said in a separate statement that it will send 1,960 people as a peacekeeping force to the region. Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev says that Turkey – which supports Azerbaijan – will also participate in the peacekeeping mission.On Monday, the Armenia-backed government in Nagorno-Karabakh confirmed the loss of the strategically important town of Sjusha, having initially denied it.Aliyev announced the news on Sunday, whereupon crowds gathered in the streets of the Azeri capital Baku and waved flags.Sjusja is located at an altitude above the largest resort of Stepanakert and Azeri forces were said to have their sights set on it.Russian helicopter shot downEarlier on Monday evening, Russian and Armenian authorities reported that a Russian military helicopter had been shot down in Armenia, near the town of Jerash, which is near the border with the Azeri exclave of Nachitjevan.Shortly after the shooting was announced, Azerbaijan stepped forward and claimed responsibility. The country's Foreign Ministry states that it was done by mistake and in the evening presented an apology to Russia with an offer of financial redress.Two people were killed and one injured in the shooting.";N
LT;Aliyev: Nagorno-Karabakh will not have any special status;"There can be no talk of any status. There is a united Azerbaijan - a multi-ethnic, multi-denominational country, he said on Monday during a visit to the districts of Fizul and Jebrail, whose control passed to Azerbaijan. Images of his trip were shown on state television on Tuesday.According to Aliyev, Armenians living in the region will be granted the same rights as other Azerbaijani citizens.""All citizens of Azerbaijan, representing different nations and religions, live in conditions of peace and good neighborliness.The Armenian people will also live in these conditions, ""said the Azerbaijani leader.He added that Baku considers the Armenians of Karabakh to be its citizens.The situation in Nagorno-Karabakh was complicated on 27 September, when active fighting broke out in the disputed area.November 9 Russian President Vladimir Putin, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian have signed a joint statement on a complete cessation of hostilities in Nagorno-Karabakh.The Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh began in February 1988, when the Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region declared its withdrawal from the Azerbaijani SSR.In September 1991, the establishment of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic was announced at the Autonomous Administrative Center of Stepanakert.In the wake of the military conflict, Azerbaijan lost control of Nagorno-Karabakh.";A
RS;All actions Azerbaijan is taking are within its own, internationally recognised borders – Karabakh is Azerbaijan;"In the background of the general debates of the 75th President of the United State, At a time when the world is battling the Covid-19 pandemic, Armenia's aggressive military political leadership has resorted to another military adventure and provocation.September 27th, 2020. Armenian armed forces, grossly violating the cease-fire regime, began firing large-caliber weapons, mortars and artillery of different calibres on positions and densely populated villages of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Among the civilian population and military faces of Azerbaijan, there are dead and wounded. It also caused serious damage to homes and civilian facilities, killed 13 Azerbaijani djivils, including 2 children and 2 elderly people, and hospitalised more than 40 civilians.In order to prevent the next military aggression of Armenia and to provide security for densely populated areas of the civilian population along the separation line, the Armed Forces of the Republic of Azerbaijan are taking counteroffensive and proportionate measures within the right to self-defence and in full compliance with international humanitarian law.Another Armenian aggression against Azerbaijan constitutes a gross violation of fundamental norms and principles of international law, UN Security Council Resolution no. 822, 853, 874 and 884 in 1993.

[Getty)Turkey's role has a steady character in the region, and from the first moment the world community learned that Armenia had invaded Azerbaijan, Turkey unequivocally declared its support for Azerbaijan in support of international law. That is precisely what Turkey's role is all about, in nothing else. Turkey is providing us with moral support and we are grateful to the Turkish leadership, the President and the Turkish people for their solidarity and support. Turkey does not participate in this conflict in any other capacity. And all the rumours that Turkey is participating as a side in the conflict, spreading from the Armenian side, have a provocative character – it's fake news.Armenia's military authorities are still expected to respond to the two downed SU-25s. Armenia, for propaganda purposes and in an attempt to hide its shame, tried to blame the stealth F16 plane.Turkish Military Air Force F-16s do not in any way participate in the war. Today, considering modern technologies, it is very difficult to hide something, since there are objective ways of tracking, there are satellite observations, and therefore it is very easy to verify that this is another provocation. We understand the goal of the Armenian side – to create such fake news, for one thing, in order to disparage the combat capability of the Azerbaijani army, which now honourably fulfils the task of restoring territorial integrity, and also to create an impression that the conflict is flammable, to involve third countries, and thus to try to attract as many countries as possible to justify your provocation. Turkey is not a party to the conflict, it is not participating in it in any way and there is no need for it.In recent days, we have witnessed a campaign of smear and slander in some foreign media about allegedly ""militants from Syria being deployed to Azerbaijan"". There is no doubt that Armenia is behind these allegations, which are not based on any facts and spread in the form of interviews with fictional people. This defamatory campaign is intended to compensate for negative international public opinion, created on the basis of the demonstrative relocation of representatives of terrorist organisations from the Middle East to the occupied territoriesAzerbaijan by Armenia, a gross violation of international humanitarian law.There are numerous facts about armenia's use of terrorist groups and mercenaries in military operations during the occupation of Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding regions of Azerbaijan. Currently, the Armenian leadership continues this policy and widely uses extremist elements against Azerbaijan as part of its new act of aggression. So, the planArmenia to create ""voluntary militant groups"" to be used for military purposes is aimed at using the ""services"" of terrorists who have been moved to Armenia from the Middle East for years.Unlike Armenia, which has been experiencing a serious demographic crisis for years in which it has been unable to equip its armed forces, Azerbaijan, as has already been stated, has a full-scale armed force, and these armed forces are so professional and strong that no external forces, especially irregular groups, are needed to achieve the set goal.These false claims are incompatible from a military-technical standpoint because they lack simple logic. Various sources claim several hundred mercenaries were allegedly brought to Azerbaijan. That's when such a question is asked: In the context of a possible conflict between the two regular armies, can a small number of irregular groups change the power ratio? Of course, those who spread misinformation are unable to answer this question.Armenian media reported that two journalists from the French newspaper Le Monde were injured in the occupied Nagorno-Karabakh region of the Republic of Azerbaijan.We would like to note that Armenia is organising visits by journalists in the area of military operations, endangering the lives of foreign journalists and grossly violating international humanitarian law.We are reminded that the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Azerbaijan issued an official statement on 27 February. September 2020. In 2013, the Azerbaijan Army did not target civilians and civilian infrastructure and that, unlike the occupied Armenia, it meets the requirements of international humanitarian law provisions , including the Geneva Conventions during military operations.The deliberate detention of foreign journalists in the danger zone clearly demonstrates that the Armenian government is ignoring its obligations to ensure the safety of journalists and to use foreign journalists for their propaganda purposes.We appeal to foreign journalists to obtain the consent of the Azerbaijani side regarding visits to the occupied Nagorno-Karabakh and the neighbouring regions of the Republic of Azerbaijan.Azerbaijan has repeatedly warned the international community that Armenia is preparing for a new act of aggression and war, and that the presence of Armenian armed forces in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan is a major threat to regional peace and stability.";A
LT;Almost 30 years later, history repeats itself: only this time the Armenians leave home;After more than a month of bloody war in Nagorno-Karabakh, the news is unexpected: Azerbaijan and Armenia have decided to lay down their arms through Vladimir Putin. Thousands of Moscow peacekeepers are being brought into the region to ensure that the disputed territories now ruled by Armenia are handed over to Azerbaijan. While Baku rejoices in winning the war, thousands of angry Armenians stormed the country’s parliament in Yerevan, accusing the country’s government of treason.;A

The meeting took place in connection with the end of the ambassador‘s diplomatic mission in Moldova, the government’s communication and protocol department has reported.    The PM expressed appreciation for the contribution of the ambassador and the diplomatic mission in Moldova to the development and boosting of the friendship and cooperation relations between the two countries in diverse sectors of mutual interest. The interlocutors tackled also prospects for the continuous development of the cooperation ties on the commercial and economic, cultural dimension between Moldova and Armenia. Ion Chicu expressed the cabinet’s willingness to turn to good account the present potential in the priority fields on the bilateral collaboration agenda, as well as the interaction on regional and international cooperation platforms.  „We appreciate the ascendant character of the cooperation between Moldova and Armenia in more sectors of common interest and we express firm confidence that we have an increased potential for fostering the bilateral cooperation in all fields of common interest and especially in the commercial and economic sphere, strengthening the cultural relations,’’ the prime minister said.For his part, the ambassador of Armenia to Moldova thanked the prime minister for the consistent dialogue and support provided to boost the multidimensional cooperation between the two countries.  In the end, the two officials expressed openness for the continuous consolidation of the relations between Moldova and Armenia for the benefit of the two countries and nations. ;E
RU;America no longer ‘a neighbor to every country on Earth’ — surprise Armenia/Azerbaijan armistice evidence of changing world order;This week’s surprise Nagorno-Karabakh deal heralds a new approach to settling conflicts, where only players directly affected get a say in their settlement. The Western liberal order no longer controls the direction of the world.The cessation of hostilities in Nagorno-Karabakh and the adjustments in the future configuration of the region, offered by the peaceful settlement, matter beyond the regional context. It is another example of employing a new conflict resolution model, when only the countries for whom finding balance is vitally important participate in the peace talks. Other players, which are not directly involved in the situation and are only in it for the influence and prestige, don’t get a say.We all understand why this is important for the South Caucasus. The status quo established after the 1993-1994 war had been maintained here for 26 years. Armenia won that war. The balance of power and international context has drastically shifted since then, but the situation in the conflict zone remained the same.Diplomatic efforts by Russia and other countries had been largely unsuccessful, because the opposing sides had no real interest in resolving the issue. Both countries claimed to be in the right. Azerbaijan had the moral ground (this is our land), while Armenia used the power argument (we won the war). Add to that the long and complicated history of violence against one another.The idea that this problem couldn't be solved through compromise has been prevalent for decades. Therefore, the goal was to make sure the sides didn’t use military force to resolve the conflict. In order to do that, the international community had to monitor the balance of mutual deterrence in the region, so that neither country could hope to win a potential war. For a quarter of a century, this approach worked.However, the world began to change rapidly in the mid-2010s. It became obvious that the liberal order led by the US and Western countries was no longer capable of controlling international relations. There were several contributing factors: from the growing influence of non-Western players and more complexity in the global balance to the crisis inside the Western world itself.As the so-called rules-based mechanism began to lose its power and the global institutions, which support the Western order, started to deteriorate, the demands and ambitions of many other countries became more obvious. Predominantly, these countries felt like the Western-led world order restrained their legitimate aspirations.Thus, a more democratic world emerged. Democratic, not in the sense that there are more democracies, but that different voices are now heard in the international community. We did not see this diversity in the Cold War era, when whatever happened in the international arena was determined by the rules of bipolar confrontation, or immediately after, during the short period of the West’s domination. And in this diverse environment we saw the rise of new powers who were seeking to lead – in the regional context at the very least, and occasionally even at a global level. In the past, their ambition would have been thwarted by superpowers, but that is no longer the case in the 21st century.What do their general musings have to do with Nagorno-Karabakh? Everything. Turkey emerged as an independent and assertive player. Russia, having recovered after the collapse of the USSR, reclaimed a more confident foreign policy, and started reassessing its priorities in a new reality. Azerbaijan managed to stick to a flexible and relatively neutral course, which allowed it to grow its arsenal through multiple channels. All of the above created opportunities for more variations in how this major regional crisis could develop. Eventually, the balance of opportunities changed so much that it enabled a new military scenario — and with a different outcome. Partly it was because Armenia, for example, hadn’t fully realized the scale of those changes.After several weeks of fighting, a truce was brokered. What does it mean?Armenia suffered a heavy defeat, which is bound to have domestic political consequences. It was only Russia’s diplomatic and peace-making efforts that saved it from consequences of a more devastating kind. Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh managed to avoid the worst-case scenarios, but the wound is deep. Now they have to reflect on what happened and find a way to heal — try it the military way again or opt for a new form of nation-building.Azerbaijan didn’t get everything it wanted (i.e. to reintegrate Nagorno-Karabakh), but seized control of strategically important areas and evened the score after its defeat in 1994, which had fueled the nation’s insecurities for years. Baku is unlikely to be satisfied with these results forever, but at this point they are celebrating a victory and the taste of it will last for a while.Turkey scored a win. Not risking a thing, Ankara invested money in equipping Azerbaijan’s army and turned into a major player in the South Caucasus. Under different circumstances, it would not have been able to do so. The partnership-rivalry relations between Russia and Turkey were strengthened through Syria and Libya. It’s a very strange relationship — based not on trust, mutual liking or shared interests, but rather on the understanding that if they oppose each other, neither country can reach its strategic goals. That’s why they have to somehow negotiate and minimize tensions. It’s an extremely confrontational kind of cooperation, but a surprisingly productive one.Russia’s actions were uncharacteristically elegant. Moscow’s ties with Yerevan strengthened: Armenia now depends on Russia more than it did before the war. Russia’s relationship with Azerbaijan is not ruined either, since Moscow played the role of a useful intermediary rather than solely the enemy’s ally. With Turkey, the relations became more complicated, but proved their effectiveness. In the long term, Turkey’s presence in the Caucasus might lead to certain challenges, but there was no way to avoid that. And Russia’s military presence in this strategically important region has grown, which is a good thing.What we saw was a kind of a Great Game of the 21st century on a regional level, with moderate losses and relatively low stakes. On a global scale, though, the outcome is more significant. During the Cold War, any regional conflict was part of the rivalry between the two superpowers. No conflict played out without them participating in it in some form or another. After the Cold War, the United States became “the neighbor to every country on Earth” (the expression was introduced by Askar Akayev, former president of Kyrgyzstan). America and its European allies thought that they had to participate in every conflict resolution — directly or through Western-led institutions like the OSCE, the EU, or NATO. It made sense, since the world order was based on the principles of liberal globalization, established by the West.The peaceful settlement in Nagorno-Karabakh (and before that, the military and diplomatic efforts around Syria and Libya) is an example of a process that only involves those who are directly affected by it, those for whom it is vitally important to find a solution. Indeed, it turns out that in certain cases it is a lot more efficient, as all parties get down to business without dancing around the issue. And they don’t burden the process with too much ideology, which overloaded liberal institutions after the Cold War. This is not the ultimate remedy, of course, but had the conflict resolution in Nagorno-Karabakh continued to rely on the OSCE Minsk Group, nobody would have found a way out of the dark dead end.There are no illusions or euphoria. Nothing is over. However, there is now a roadmap that seems more realistic in today’s world — harsh and fragmented, but still closely connected.;N
FR;Armenia - France establishing a mechanism to assist Armenians affected by the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh (22 November 2020);At the request of President Macron and the Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs, France is establishing a structured effort to assist Armenians affected by the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh. Coordinated by a steering committee at the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs’ Crisis and Support Center, this mechanism mobilizes the efforts of the government, associations promoting solidarity with Armenia, humanitarian organizations belonging to Coordination Sud, corporate foundations and hospitals. It focuses on three areas.1/ After initial emergency actions in recent weeks involving the dispatch of surgeons and medical/surgical supplies to Armenia, several humanitarian flights have been organized. An initial cargo plane leased by the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs arrived in Yerevan this afternoon. It was transporting items donated by French authorities: emergency medical equipment, and in particular a Mobile Medical Station allowing for the care of 500 people as well as blankets and hygiene kits to be distributed to people affected by the conflict.A second flight has been scheduled for November 27. Its cargo will include State resources, donations collected from associations promoting solidarity with Armenia such as the Aznavour Foundation and the Union Générale Arménienne de Bienfaisance, and humanitarian cargo supplied by humanitarian organizations and corporate foundations.2/ Following on from the medical missions conducted since October, the second area of focus involves stepping up cooperation between hospitals in both countries. This will be facilitated by financial support from the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs. In France, the public hospitals of Paris, Marseille and Lyon have already been mobilized.3/ The third area focuses on supporting projects instituted in Armenia by humanitarian organizations and UN agencies. France will provide direct financial support for these structures that are active on the ground.Finally, local governments, some of which are already actively supporting projects in Armenia, have been invited to contribute to these three areas of focus.This mechanism for providing humanitarian assistance comes in response to the emergency situation created by the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh in recent weeks.In its capacity as co-chair of the OSCE Minsk Group together with Russia and the United States, France also remains fully committed to achieving a lasting solution to this conflict. /.;E
GR;Armenia ‘will not tolerate a second genocide,’ country’s president tells Kathimerini;Six weeks after Azeri forces launched a military offensive on Nagorno-Karabakh, the deadly clashes continue, the successive ceasefires collapse before the ink on the deal has even dried, and the noose around the Armenians is tightening. In this interview with Kathimerini, Armenian President Armen Sarkissian speaks of an attempted ethnic cleansing against the people of Nagorno-Karabakh, adding that his people will not tolerate a second genocide, 105 years after the historic crime carried out by the Ottoman Empire.Sarkissian claims that Turkey has already transferred jihadi mercenaries from fighting in Syria and Libya, “like those who are now in Paris and Vienna or elsewhere killing innocent citizens.”Concerning a political solution to the problem, he says that the attack launched by Baku, with support from Ankara, “dramatically dispelled any desultory hope that some foreign experts used to harbor about peaceful coexistence of the Karabakh Armenians and Azerbaijanis within the boundaries of Azerbaijan.” The dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh has turned from a frozen conflict into a war of attrition for the last six weeks. Could you describe the situation on the ground and give us an idea of the human toll for the Armenian people?I wouldn’t call the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict “frozen” because the Azeri side has always been trying to change and challenge the status quo by military means since a ceasefire was established between Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan back in 1994 reached with the mediation of Russia. Instead of using the negotiation table to reach a final solution to the conflict during almost three decades, the Azeri side not only didn’t refrain from regularly and deliberately violating the ceasefire agreement and killing Armenian soldiers on the line of contact and civilians, both in Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia, but it was buying a large amount of modern weaponry worth billions of US dollars, including some prohibited ones, and turning the entire region into a powder keg. Moreover, Azerbaijan has been preparing its own population for a war, while the Armenian side then and now was a strong proponent of peaceful solution, and the Armenian elites were even sometimes criticized by some opposition representatives for being too peace-oriented instead of increasing military spending and harsh rhetoric.Since the early 90s, Azerbaijan has increased its military budget by 10 times, and has never refrained from heavy xenophobic and militaristic rhetoric. Now we are witnessing its genocidal intentions in full action. Moreover, this inhuman aggression unleashed by the non-democratic Azerbaijani regime on September 27 is militarily and politically supported by another non-democratic regime in Turkey. Dictatorships don’t care about the destiny and prosperity of their own people, let alone respect simple human lives, values and dignity. A non-democratic regime, be it in Baku, Ankara or elsewhere, builds its “strength” and “pride” on the suffering of its own people, and hence, is of course more than inhuman toward other nations. Nagorno-Karabakh is not a conflict but a struggle of the pride of the Armenian nation for its security, proud life and dignity vs killings, humiliations and suffering.As for the human toll of the Armenian people, there is always official daily information provided by the Armenian government which doesn’t hide those figures, unlike the Azeri side, which doesn’t deliver any information about its human or other losses. Every life of the Armenian side matters for us, and it’s not about numbers or mathematics. The beating of every single heart of the Armenian side is priceless to us, and we need to stop the bloodshed.Who is to blame for the violations of three consecutive, temporary ceasefire agreements?All three ceasefires or humanitarian truce agreements have been almost immediately violated by the Azerbaijani side, which not only didn’t stop its bombardments, but shelled the territory of Armenia as well. This may sound illogical to you if you want to understand why an agreement is reached if the Azeri side is not going to respect but just to breach it immediately. Well, the logic is that the Azeri, not the Armenian side unleashed this well-planned and designed military aggression and war with a direct participation of Turkish generals, officers, special military units, Bayraktar death machines, as well as jihadists and Syrian mercenaries like those who are now in Paris and Vienna or elsewhere killing innocent citizens. The same is here in Nagorno-Karabakh: professional killers of Azerbaijan and Turkey against innocent people. Why does the Azeri side sign but is then motivated to violate ceasefires? It’s simple: Those dictators both in Baku and Ankara didn’t finish with their “mission,” which lies in “freeing” Nagorno-Karabakh from the Armenians living there for thousands of years.This operation or policy is called ethnic cleansing, which is the ultimate goal of this inhuman aggression by Azerbaijan and Turkey against the population of Nagorno-Karabakh. That’s why the Azeri side is not interested in stopping its genocidal policy against the innocent people, but to finalize it. Under the name of establishing their control over Nagorno-Karabakh, they don’t want peace but tragedies, killing of civilians, destroying churches, hospitals and kindergartens, and spreading terror. Who on earth will agree to live with those barbarian terrorists? During about 25 years of negotiations Azerbaijan didn’t agree to any scenarios discussed under the auspices of the OSCE Minsk Group co-chairs, be it mediated by Russia, the US or France, or by all three co-chairs altogether. Because the only option Azerbaijan was in favor of, is to have Nagorno-Karabakh without Armenians. This is what happened 105 years ago with my nation in the Ottoman Empire, known as the Armenian Genocide. We will never allow another genocide to happen. Never! And this is what the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is about.Your Azeri counterpart, President Ilham Aliyev, insists that a military solution to the conflict is feasible. Given the fact that Azerbaijan outnumbers Armenia in terms of military equipment and manpower, how could you possibly prove him wrong?My nation doesn’t need to prove anything to anybody. The strength of the Armenian Armed Forces and the spirit of the Armenian nation were showcased during the first war in Nagorno-Karabakh in the late 80s. So, it’s not about a simple calculation of numbers and quantity. We fight for our homes, our homeland, children, and the preservation of the Armenian cultural heritage of thousands of years. This is what some fail to understand. This conflict was imposed on us because Nagorno-Karabakh, overwhelmingly populated by Armenians, didn’t want to continue its forced existence with Soviet Azerbaijan and declared independence from Azerbaijan according to all existing rules and laws – by the way, applying the same procedures that Azerbaijan used to get its independence from the Soviet Union. The Azeri side, as a true dictatorship, doesn’t like freedoms and rights of its own and other peoples, and they tried to solve the problem with the Armenians living in Nagorno-Karabakh by using military equipment and manpower, outnumbering Armenians, as you put it. So, they imposed war on us, and got retaliated against and defeated. Nothing and nobody can stop a nation from exerting its right to live freely and in security.Would it be fair to say that the president of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, encourages Baku to adopt a most intransigent behavior? If so, to what end?The role of Turkey in this conflict deserves special attention and understanding. This direct participation increases the number of conflicting sides, and internationalizes the conflict. Turkey’s proven involvement on the ground, although denied by the Turkish side, levels up the conflict and dramatically increases the scope, the magnitude and hence the consequences of the military aggression by Azerbaijan. The presence of fanatic jihadists and Syrian and other mercenaries renders the whole picture even more complex and complicated and endangers the security of the entire region which can turn the Caucasus into a new Syria.Not only does Turkey encourage Baku to become a blind killer of peaceful people and to violate ceasefire agreements, but it keeps Azerbaijan as its hostage, transforming it into its new tool of political manipulation against Russia, the EU, the US and Iran. In the short term, Azerbaijan can be happy to have Turkey by its side and have its full support in the war against peaceful Nagorno-Karabakh, but in the mid- and long terms, it will be a failure, and only then will Azerbaijan realize to what extent it has become Turkey’s Caucasian puppet at the expense of its own politico-economic independence, maneuverability, stability and predictability. Turkey is a regional player with imperialistic ambitions and appetite, but with limited resources and a fading international reputation. It is messing up in Syria, Libya, the Eastern Mediterranean etc. So, using Azerbaijan to achieve its goals by also encouraging and pushing it to unleash a war is the least it can do in the region and beyond.Ankara and Baku portray themselves as guarantors of Europe’s energy security, claiming that Armenian forces could shell the oil and gas pipelines crossing the region. Is it a real threat or just scaremongering?This is a matter of unsubstantiated allegations and respective propaganda the government of Azerbaijan and the paid propagandists of its national interests in the West and elsewhere have tended to spread for decades. The consistent attempts to portray Armenia as a destructive force of the region that allegedly “poses a threat” to the energy infrastructure was and still remains a backbone of anti-Armenian fictional narratives the Azerbaijani side has fostered for foreign audiences. This aims to serve as moral justification for the ongoing aggression and war it wages against the Armenians. Despite numerous fabrications and intentional false interpretations diligently pushed by the Azerbaijani side on this matter, I can find no statement or sign of hidden intention by any acting Armenian top official ever which might contribute to such allegations. To the contrary, as recently as in July, when the fighting in the Tavush/Tovuz sector of the Armenia-Azerbaijan state border reached its apogee, the incumbent prime minister of Armenia, Nikol Pashinyan, came up with a clear statement reiterating that Armenia has never had any intention or plan to harm the oil and gas supplies stretching close to the Armenian border. Moreover, the Armenian side remained constructive with regard to the energy infrastructure that appears important for the economies of Europe, Turkey, Israel and so forth, prudently highlighting its share of responsibility with regard to the security of those critical economic arteries.After all, if Armenia ever wanted to target and destroy the gas and oil pipelines, it has had multiple chances to do so. But why should we? After years of groundless and irrelevant Azerbaijani scaremongering and subtle manipulations to seed anti-Armenian sentiments abroad, it is regrettable to see that some political circles in Europe and beyond have started to buy some misleading fake narratives such as this one.Russia is seen as a trusted and proactive mediatorRussia is an ally of Armenia, and has signed military agreements with it which do not include the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. Moscow is currently acting as an honest peace broker, a non-biased mediator. Do you expect something more at these most difficult times for your nation?Russia is Armenia’s strategic ally, and Moscow remains committed to the security-related treaty arrangements it has with Yerevan. President Vladimir Putin made it clear that Russia is going to respect each agreement Russia has with Armenia, and this is an absolutely clear message. During a recent discussion, Vladimir Putin pointed out that while the overall bilateral relationship is growing positively, the interests of Turkey and Russia do not coincide when it comes to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Here in Armenia, in the context of the politico-military rivalry with Azerbaijan, Russia is seen as a trusted and proactive mediator between the conflicting sides. Russia plays a crucial role here and it demonstrated its commitment to finding a peaceful solution to the conflict by brokering a ceasefire on October 10. And we must admit, it was a courageous and timely move, even though the Azeri side remained aggressively stubborn and fully destructive, violating the ceasefire.One of the key problems at this stage of the conflict that is of mutual concern to Yerevan and Moscow is the appearance of jihadists from Syria, Libya and elsewhere that Turkey transfers to Azerbaijan for their further fighting against Armenians. According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, about 2,000 of them have already reached the region. For decades, the region was free from Islamic fundamentalism, and now we have such a non-state actor inside Azerbaijan that employs terrorism as a new inhuman tool against civilians. This is a very destructive factor for regional destabilization, something atypical for our region, and indeed poses a serious challenge not only for the regional powers, but first and foremost for the Caucasus states proper, since the jihadist mercenaries in Azerbaijan increase the security risks for global projects and foreign infrastructure investments. By the way, those mercenaries pose a real direct threat to Azerbaijani society as well.Armenia appreciates Moscow’s efforts as both treaty ally and honest broker to stop the flaring and hybrid war perpetrated by Azerbaijan and Turkey, and I am confident that this challenge we are facing now is positively testing the tight strategic bond between Armenia and Russia.After one-and-a-half months of warfare, the Azeris have made territorial gains and a return to the status quo ante seems impossible. What kind of political solution would seem both realistic and acceptable to you?Let me put it this way. The intensive phase of the war in Nagorno-Karabakh is under way, and diverse tactical maneuvers cannot be considered territorial losses or gains. Let me remind you that in summer 1992, it might have seemed like the Armenian side was losing the war, seeking to repel the Azerbaijanis’ first aggression against the people of Nagorno-Karabakh. But by May 1994, when Azerbaijan desperately asked for a ceasefire, the situation on the ground was starkly different.As for the political solution, it is clear that such cruel and inhuman aggression perpetrated by Azerbaijan and orchestrated by Turkey, accompanied by multiple cases of war crimes and inhuman treatment of prisoners of war, dramatically dispelled any desultory hope that some foreign experts used to harbor about peaceful coexistence of the Karabakh Armenians and Azerbaijanis within the boundaries of Azerbaijan. For the Armenian side, this aggression once again came to justify that the only realistic option for the Armenians of Karabakh to survive is the recognition of their right to live and develop in their historical homeland outside Azerbaijan. So the only recipe of survival for the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh is to acknowledge that Karabakh, with its reliable territorial connection to Armenia, can never be part of Azerbaijan.A natural allianceThe Armenian and the Greek peoples are connected by historical and cultural ties. What would you expect from our government and our people at this critical moment of your history?Greece and Greeks have a special place in the minds and hearts of the Armenians. The natural alliance of the Armenians and Greeks was multiply tested through the centuries, making our bond not only historical or cultural, but civilizational, based on people-to-people sympathy, a similar mentality, a shared historical destiny. The dynamics of political relations between our nations has proved that Armenia and Greece might benefit from a shared geopolitical vision and state-to-state strategic relationship, projecting our regional standings together. One vivid example is the trajectory of strategic trilateral partnership between Greece, Armenia and Cyprus. As long as the threat to our interests and security comes from the same source, Greece has a strong position in the European institutions at large and in NATO in particular, to exert pressure on a consistently defiant and increasingly unreliable Turkey. Greece is in place to raise legitimate concern and a set of actions underpinning or, if necessary, representing Armenia’s voice in this matter. We may unite our political weight and capabilities to take tangible measures along with other allies in the West to institutionally make Turkey and Azerbaijan accountable for their destabilizing and destructive actions. ;E
FR;Armenia – Visit by Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne as part of the French humanitarian operation (Yerevan, 27-28 November 2020);Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne, Minister of State for Tourism, French Nationals Abroad and Francophonie, attached to the Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs, visited Yerevan on November 17 and 28 accompanied by Kristina Aznavour, CEO of the Aznavour Foundation, and. Youri Djorkaeff, whom President Macron appointed to mobilize French aid for Armenia.This visit was in line with the humanitarian effort instituted by President Macron and Foreign Minister Le Drian for the population affected by the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and was coordinated by the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs’ Crisis and Support Center.The delegation led by the Minister of State arrived aboard an aircraft leased by the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs that carried donations collected by the Aznavour Foundation and humanitarian cargo supplied by humanitarian organizations and corporate foundations. This flight followed an initial cargo flight that arrived in Yerevan on November 22 carrying official donations of emergency medical equipment, including a Mobile Medical Station capable of serving 500 people, blankets, and hygiene kits. Mr. Lemoyne delivered these donations in the presence of Armenian Health Minister Arsen Torosyan. He visited sites that receive French aid, including two hospitals that care for seriously wounded patients and a city hall that welcomes people who had to flee the conflict.Mr. Lemoyne was hosted by Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Foreign Minister Ara Ayvazyan. He assured his interlocutors of France’s determination to work actively in support of a negotiated settlement to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in its capacity as Co-Chair of the Minsk Group. He was also welcomed at the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin by the Catholicos of All Armenians Karekin II, the supreme head of the Armenian Apostolic Church, to whom he reaffirmed France’s commitment to protecting the historic and religious heritage of the region, on which it works with UNESCO.;E

RU;Armenia agreed armistice with Azerbaijan to save soldiers’ lives, reveals embattled PM Pashinyan;Armenia had to agree a truce with Baku, or its 25,000-man army faced being completely surrounded and routed. That’s according to Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, who is under increasing pressure to explain why he ended the war.In an address to the nation on Thursday, Pashinyan explained that the trilateral ceasefire agreement signed by Yerevan, Baku, and Moscow does not imply a final settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.“When a situation arises when a soldier can no longer influence the situation, then he should not die in the name of his homeland, but the homeland should make sacrifices in the name of the soldier,” Pashinyan explained. “With this understanding, I signed the infamous document, understanding that my risk of dying is high, not only in the political, but also in the physical sense.”In the early hours of Tuesday morning, the prime minister announced that the country had agreed to end hostilities with Azerbaijan, following a bloody conflict which began in late September. After repeatedly claiming that Armenia was winning the war, he is now coming under attack for what many locals see as a surrender. As part of the settlement, Yerevan has lost control of parts of Nagorno-Karabakh, and Russian peacekeepers have been deployed along the contact line.According to Pashinyan, he knew that the peace deal would lead to public discontent, but he believes it was the correct choice to protect his soldiers.“This happened after the General Staff of the Armed Forces reported that the war should be urgently stopped, and the president of Artsakh said Stepanakert [the largest city in Nagorno-Karabakh] could be lost within hours,” Pashinyan explained.On Wednesday, over a thousand Armenian demonstrators, led by opposition leaders, took to Yerevan’s streets to protest the signing of the agreement. Protesters chanted “Nikol is a traitor,” while demanding he resign as leader of the country.;N
VA;Armenia and Azerbaijan accuse each other of violating latest ceasefire;"New clashes were reported between Azerbaijan and Armenia just hours after the US President had proudly announced on social networking site Twitter that his team managed to negotiate a ceasefire between the warring Caucasus nations.  The US-brokered truce was a third attempt to establish a lasting ceasefire in the flare-up of a decades-old conflict over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. Two previous Russia-brokered agreements, including one last weekend, collapsed immediately after taking force, with both sides blaming each other for violations.The new ceasefire was also challenged quickly by accusations from both sides. Azerbaijani Defense Ministry alleged that Armenian forces fired at Azerbaijani settlements and the positions of the Azerbaijani army. It said attacks happened ""along the entire front, as well as on the Armenia-Azerbaijan state border"" and involved various small arms, mortars, and howitzers.Armenian denial Armenian military officials rejected the accusations and accused Azerbaijani forces of shelling the northeastern area of Nagorno-Karabakh and other regions. Local authorities in Nagorno-Karabakh also charged that Azerbaijan targeted the town of Martuni with military aviation. Azerbaijan's Defense Ministry denied it violated the ceasefire agreement. Amongst the population in Nagorno-Karabakh, there are Christian and Catholic communities including one that worships in the 19th-century Armenian Apostolic cathedral in the town of Shusha. The Holy Saviour Cathedral, also known as Ghazanchetsots, was heavily damaged in recent shelling, allegedly by Azerbaijan's forces. But priests there can still be seen ringing the bells and praying for the victims and for peace inside the damaged church. 'Prayers reaching God'""It doesn't matter if these prayers come from basements, houses, or churches - all prayers reach God,"" said Armenian priest Andreas Tavadyan. ""To be honest, there are far more dangerous places in Artsakh [the Armenian name for Nagorno-Karabakh]. There is a front line which is really dangerous. But this is our front line: we have to fight the evil, we pray. It's our [spiritual] battlefield."" He added: ""I believe this danger is not that important for us. No matter if we see that the cathedral is damaged, we know God is in all of our prayers. God will save us."" Nagorno-Karabakh lies within Azerbaijan, a mainly Muslim nation, but has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia, which is primarily Christian, since a war there ended in 1994. The latest fighting that began on September 27 has involved heavy artillery, rockets, and drones. The violence has officially killed more than 1,000 people in the largest escalation of hostilities over the separatist region in more than a quarter-century.Russian President Vladimir Putin said last week that Moscow's information suggests the death toll from the fighting was nearing 5,000, significantly higher than what both sides report.";N
UK;Armenia and Azerbaijan accuse each other of violating new Nagorno-Karabakh truce;Armenia and Azerbaijan accused each other on Sunday of violating a new humanitarian ceasefire in fighting over the mountain enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, hours after it was agreed. The truce agreed on Saturday came into force at midnight (2000 GMT) after a week-old Russian-brokered ceasefire failed to halt the worst fighting in the South Caucasus since the 1990s. The Armenian defence ministry said the Azeri army had fired twice during the night and used artillery. The Azeri defence ministry said: “The enemy fired at the vicinity of the Jabrail city, as well as the villages of this region ... using mortars and artillery”. It added that the Azeri army “took adequate retaliatory measures”. Officials in Nagorno-Karabakh said Azeri forces had launched an attack on the enclave's military positions and there were casualties and wounded on both sides. Nagorno-Karabakh is a mountain territory that is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but populated and governed by ethnic Armenians. The ceasefire earlier this month was aimed at letting the sides swap detainees and bodies of those killed in the clashes, but it had little impact on the fighting around the enclave. The new truce was announced on Saturday after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov talked to his Armenian and Azeri counterparts by phone and called on sides to observe the truce that he mediated a week ago. Russia, France and the United States belong to the Minsk Group, which has attempted to help resolve the conflict under the umbrella of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Baku said on Saturday that 60 Azeri civilians had been killed and 270 wounded since the fighting flared on 27 September. It has not disclosed its military casualties. Nagorno-Karabakh says 633 of its military personnel have been killed, and 36 civilians.;N
RO;Armenia and Azerbaijan accuse each other of violating the newly concluded peace agreement;"The Nagorno-Karabakh ceasefire agreement appears to be a hard promise to keep. Within half an hour of its entry into force, the forces of Armenia and Azerbaijan resumed bombing. As usual, the two sides accuse each other of a breach of the deal, which comes after two weeks of fighting, according to CNN.At a news conference in Baku, Hikmet Hajiev, an adviser to Azerbaijani President Ilham Alimev, accused Armenia of ""violating"" the agreed conditions.""Azerbaijan has no claims to the territory of any other state. If Armenia continues its challenges, Azerbaijan mustrespond,"" hesaid.Armenia denied violating the agreement, saying it was an ""invention"". Instead, he claimed that Azerbaijani forces had attacked the city of Hadrut.""The statement of Azerbaijan's Ministry of Defence is another invention, said aspokesman for the Armenian Ministry of Defence.The agreement was reached last night in Moscowat the end of ten hours of talks. Mediated by Russia, France and the United States, it provides, among other things, for prisoner exchanges between the two parties.The weapons will be temporarily silent to allow the exchange of prisoners of war, the movement of other persons and the recovery of the bodies of those killed, according to the criteria of the International Committee of the Red Cross, but the ""specific parameters"" of the implementation of the ceasefire agreement were to be agreed after the conclusion of the discussions sponsored by Sergei Lavrov.Armenia and Azerbaijan have also reached an agreement to start ""substantial negotiations"" for a peaceful resolution of the conflict, with the mediation of the co-chairs of the Minsk Group of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).The Nagorno-Karabakh region is an administrative part of Azerbaijan, but is inhabited mostly by Armenians. The two countries have faced each other several times in recent decades without reaching a compromise.The official death toll on Friday indicated more than 400 dead, including 22 Armenian civilians and 31 Azerbaijanis. But there is unreliable data, and in reality it could be much higher, with each side claiming to have eliminated thousands of enemy soldiers.";N
IR;Armenia and Azerbaijan agree to end fighting;Armenia and Azerbaijan have announced an agreement to halt fighting over the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan under a pact signed with Russia that calls for the deployment of Russian peacekeepers as well as territorial concessions. Nagorno-Karabakh has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a 1994 truce ended a separatist war in which an estimated 30,000 people died. Sporadic clashes have occurred since then, and full-scale fighting began on September 27. Several cease-fires had been called but were almost immediately violated. However, the agreement announced early on Tuesday appeared more likely to take hold because Azerbaijan has made significant advances, including taking control of the strategically key city of Shushi on Sunday. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian said on Facebook that calling an end to the fight was “extremely painful for me personally and for our people”. Soon after the announcement, thousands of people streamed to the main square in the Armenian capital Yerevan to protest the agreement, many shouting, “We won’t give up our land”. Some of them broke into the main government building, saying they were searching for Mr Pashinian, who apparently had already departed. The agreement calls for Armenian forces to turn over control of some areas it held outside the borders of Nagorno-Karabakh, including the eastern district of Agdam. That area carries strong symbolic weight for Azerbaijan because its main city, also called Agdam, was thoroughly pillaged, and the only building remaining intact is the city’s mosque. Armenians will also turn over the Lachin region, which holds the main road leading from Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia. The agreement calls for the road, the so-called Lachin Corridor, to remain open and be protected by Russian peacekeepers. In all, 1,960 Russian peacekeepers are to be deployed in the region under a five-year mandate.;N

Many lives will be saved,"" US President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter.The announcement came after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo held separate meetings with the foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan in Washington on Friday.Those meetings were joined by the co-chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group, formed to mediate the conflict and led by France, Russia and the United States, which described them as ""intensive discussions"" on the ceasefire and the beginning of talks about core elements of a comprehensive solution.The Minsk Group said its co-chairs and the foreign ministers agreed to meet again in Geneva on October 29.A senior administration official expressed confidence that this ceasefire would hold. ""US leadership with support from Russia and France brings additional hope that the ceasefire will lead to a lasting peace settlement,"" said the official.But the eruption of new fighting on Sunday and the collapse of two previous ceasefires brokered by Russia raised questions about the prospects for this fresh push to end the clashes in Nagorno-Karabakh, a part of Azerbaijan populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians.Fears of wider conflictThe fighting that broke out on September 27 over the disputed territory has surged to its worst level since the 1990s, when some 30,000 people were killed.Local officials in Nagorno-Karabakh on Sunday accused Azeri forces of firing artillery on settlements in the areas of Askeran and Martuni during the night. Azerbaijan said its positions had been attacked with small arms, mortars, tanks and howitzers.Armenia accused Azeri forces of shelling civilian settlements. Baku denied killing civilians and said it was ready to implement a ceasefire, provided Armenian forces withdrew from the battlefield.The defence ministry of the Nagorno-Karabakh region said on Sunday it had recorded another 11 casualties among its forces, pushing the military death toll to 974.Earlier on Sunday during a meeting with defense officials, Aliyev accusd Armenia of bombarding civilian sites and launching two ballistic missiles on the city of Ganja.Armenian President Armen Sarkissian accused Baku of being ""aggressively stubborn and destructive"".World powers want to prevent a wider war that draws in Turkey, which has voiced strong support for Azerbaijan, and Russia, which has a defence pact with Armenia.Differences over the conflict have further strained relations between Ankara and its NATO allies, with Pompeo accusing Turkey of fuelling the conflict by arming the Azeri side. Ankara denies it has inflamed the conflict.Sarkissian, in comments reprinted by the Armenpress news agency, called on ""global players"" to step in immediately to bring about a ceasefire and said Russia was ""a trusted and pro-active mediator"" between the conflicting sides.Aliyev said it was ""very hazardous"" for Armenia to want Russian military support in the conflict and third parties should not get involved militarily.Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he speaks to leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan several times a day by phone, and that he hopes the United States will help Moscow broker a solution to the conflict.About 30,000 people were killed in a 1991-94 war over Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenians regard the enclave as part of their historic homeland: Azeris consider it illegally occupied land that must be returned to their control. ";E
AT;Armenia and Azerbaijan at war;"Despite international calls for restraint, the fighting between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed Karabakh region continues. According to their defense ministries, both sides shot each other with heavy artillery fire on Monday night. Azerbaijan ordered a partial mobilization of the population, Armenia had already done this on Sunday for all male citizens. In addition, both countries have imposed martial law. In the worst fighting since 2016, numerous people were killed on Sunday. Nagorno-Karabakh spoke of 31 dead on his side. According to the Interfax agency, around 200 Armenians were also injured. Azerbaijan reported six civilians killed and 19 injured on its side.In view of the escalation, diplomats said the UN Security Council will hold an emergency meeting on Tuesday. The initiative for the meeting behind closed doors came from Germany and France, it said on Monday at the UN headquarters in New York. Several other European countries would have supported this.Russia and Germany had already called on the conflicting parties on Sunday to let their weapons rest. The Interfax agency quoted the Armenian ambassador to Russia on Monday as saying that Turkey had sent around 4,000 fighters from northern Syria to Azerbaijan. The Ria agency reported that the ambassador said the fighters would be deployed in Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan denied the allegations.Turkey called on Armenia on Sunday to end the hostilities. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pledged ""increased"" solidarity to traditional ally Azerbaijan after a phone call with President Ilham Aliyev. Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke on the phone with the Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan. He called on the international community to prevent Turkey from interfering in the conflict.Both parties to the conflict have accused each other of being responsible for the escalation. Azerbaijan said that Armenia had fired at Nagorno-Karabakh from the air and with artillery. The own troops then destroyed three tanks on the opposing side and shot down two helicopters and three drones. Azerbaijan disagreed, saying it responded to an Armenian attack.Long conflictSince the collapse of the Soviet Union, Armenia and Azerbaijan have been arguing over the belonging of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is mainly inhabited by Armenians and which separated from Azerbaijan in 1991. The West and the countries in the region are concerned about the conflict, as it threatens to destabilize the South Caucasus. Important oil and gas pipelines run there. Although the predominantly Christian Armenia and the predominantly Muslim Azerbaijan signed a ceasefire in 1994, both sides regularly accuse each other of attacks around Nagorno Karabakh and along the common border. At least 200 people died in April 2016 when the conflict flared up again.Chronology:1805 - Tens of thousands of Armenians from the Ottoman Empire settle in Nagorno-Karabakh again under Russian rule.1915/16 - Genocide against the Armenians in the Ottoman Empire.

UK;Armenia and Azerbaijan conflict: What’s behind new fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh region?;The mountainous region of Nagorno-Karabakh where deadly new fighting erupted last week between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces, has been in a tense limbo since a 1994 truce. The Associated Press explains what’s behind the long-unresolved conflict and its most recent flare-up: Where is Nagorno-Karabakh? Nagorno-Karabakh is a region within Azerbaijan that has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by the Armenian government for more than a quarter-century. The territory in the southern Caucasus Mountains covers an area of about 4,400 square kilometers (1,700 square miles) about the size of the U.S. state of Delaware. How did the conflict start? During the Soviet era, the mostly Armenian-populated region had an autonomous status within Azerbaijan. Long-simmering tensions between Christian Armenians and mostly Muslim Azeris began boiling over as the Soviet Union frayed in its final years The open conflict broke out in 1988 when the region made a bid to join Armenia, triggering hostilities. They escalated into a full-blown war after the USSR collapsed in 1991, which killed an estimated 30,000 people. and displaced about 1 million. By the time the war ended with a cease-fire in 1994, Armenian forces not only held Nagorno-Karabakh itself but also seized substantial areas outside the territory's borders. What’s happened since? International mediation efforts to determine the region’s final status have brought little visible progress. Landlocked Armenia has suffered badly from an economic blockade imposed by Azerbaijan and its ally, Turkey The region has remained tense and fighting periodically broke out. Scores were killed in an outbreak of hostilities in 2016, and then again this July when Azerbaijan and Armenia exchanged fire across their border. Since new fighting started on Sept. 27, the warring sides reported hundreds of deaths, making it the biggest escalation in the conflict since 1994. Nagorno-Karabakh officials said about 220 soldiers and at least 21 civilians have died in the fighting. Azerbaijani authorities haven't reported military casualties but said 27 civilians have been killed. Both sides have accused each other of expanding the hostilities onto their territory beyond Nagorno-Karabakh. The fighting involving heavy artillery, drones and warplanes has continued despite calls for a cease-fire from the West and Russia. What’s the broader impact? In addition to causing casualties and damage, the conflict in the small, hard-to-reach region is also of concern to major regional players. Orthodox Christian Russia is Armenia’s main ally and sponsor and has a military base there. NATO-member Turkey, which has close ethnic, cultural and historic bonds with Azerbaijan, has vowed its full backing to Baku in the conflict and has declared its readiness to support it militarily, if necessary. Turkey has backed Azerbaijan’s demand for Armenia’s withdrawal from Nagorno-Karabakh as a precondition for any ceasefire. Turkey has trained Azerbaijani officers for decades and the two countries, which often refer to their special relationship as one of “two states, one nation,” recently conducted military exercises in Azerbaijan. Ankara is known to have sold drones and other weapons to Azerbaijan. Iran neighbors both Armenia and Azerbaijan and is calling for calm. The United States, France and Russia are the official sponsors of the long-stalled peace process under the auspices of the Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The three countries have repeatedly called for cessation of hostilities and peace talks.;N
ES;Armenia and Azerbaijan declare a ceasefire in the war in Upper Karabakh and accuse each other of breaking it within hours;"Azerbaijan and Armenia agreed on Saturday a humanitarian truce starting at midnight this Sunday (22:00 on Saturday in Spain), according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Armenia and also confirmed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan. The truce, according to the Azerbaijani diplomacy statement, was agreed upon in response to the October 1 declaration of the presidents of the United States, Russia and France, who represent the countries co-chairs of the Minsk Group of the Organization for Security in Europe (OSCE). The ceasefire, however, has hardly had any effect. Both countries have accused each other of violating the humanitarian truce in the early hours of Sunday.The Upper Karabakh, a breakaway region of Azerbaijan populated mainly by Armenians and supported by Yerevan, has been the scene of bloody fighting since September 27. According to an official balance, although very partial, more than 700 people have died in the clashes.""Despite the declaration of a new humanitarian ceasefire, the Azerbaijani armed forces have once again violated the agreement,"" Shushan Stepanyan, a spokesman for the Armenian Ministry of Defense, wrote on his Facebook profile. Stepanián specified that ""around 7:20 (local time), with the support of artillery fire, the enemy launched an offensive in the southern sector (Judaferin reservoir) in order to occupy advantageous positions."" ""There are casualties on both sides,"" he added.In turn, the Ministry of Defense of Azerbaijan denounced that the Armenian forces attacked with mortar and artillery fire “the surroundings of the city of Dzhabraíl and the villages liberated from the occupation in the homonymous district that are located along the Araz river. ”.This was the second attempt by the belligerents to consolidate a ceasefire after almost three weeks of fighting in the disputed separatist region of Upper Karabakh, in which hundreds of people have died. Hours before the announcement of the truce, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov held telephone conversations with his Azerbaijani counterparts, Jeihun Bayramov, and Armenian, Zohrab Mnatsakanyan.According to Moscow, Lavrov insisted before his interlocutors on the importance of the agreement reached in the Russian capital to begin, together with the ceasefire, ""substantive negotiations"" in order to reach a peaceful settlement to the conflict. That ceasefire was never fully implemented, and military actions intensified instead of diminishing. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliev announced on Sunday the liberation of the city of Füzuli and seven other towns in the Armenian-occupied region of the same name south of Upper Karabakh.The Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict dates back to the times of the Soviet Union, when at the end of the 1980s the Azerbaijani territory of Upper Karabakh, populated mainly by Armenians, requested their incorporation into neighboring Armenia, after which a war broke out that caused some 25,000 deaths. At the end of the fighting, which lasted until 1994, the Armenian forces took control and also occupied vast Azerbaijani territories, which they call the “security strip”, to unite them with Armenia.Azerbaijan maintains that the solution to the conflict with Armenia necessarily involves the liberation of the occupied territories, a demand that has been supported by several resolutions of the UN Security Council. For its part, Armenia supports the right to self-determination of Upper Karabakh and advocates the participation of representatives of the separatist territory in the negotiations on the settlement of the conflict.";E
EE;FORTE INTERVIEWS The Armenian and Azerbaijani View: Who Really Owns Nagorno-Karabakh?;The Karabakh conflict began in 1988, when the Nagorno-Karabakh region, the majority of whose population was Armenian, announced its withdrawal from Azerbaijan. In the war between Nagorno-Karabakh after 1992-1994, Azerbaijan lost control of Nagorno-Karabakh and the seven regions bordering the Armenian-Karabakh Republic.Negotiations have been held since 1992 to resolve the conflict by the OSCE Minsk Group, in which, in addition to Azerbaijan, Russia, the United States and France are acting as mediators. Negotiations between Azerbaijan and Armenia have been going on for three decades, to no avail. The Nagorno-Karabakh line of control is 1992-1994. The low-intensity combat operations continued until the end of the 2016 war, and before the 2020 war, the most serious battles were in April 2016.The Armenian view: we have received pogroms and killings in response to attempts at a peaceful solutionForte first asked Ruben Mehrabjan, an expert on international relations and security in Armenia and himself from Karabakh, about the development and history of the region.Why are Armenians convinced that Nagorno-Karabakh must belong to Armenia?All you have to do is go to Nagorno-Karabakh and see what churches there are. Everything is built there by the Armenians, there is nothing to talk about here. You need to see it with your own eyes and everything will be clear.Armenians suffered one of the most horrific crimes of the 20th century, the Armenian genocide. In the current war, the balance of power is very much to the detriment of Armenia. Is there a fear of a repeat of the events of 1915 in Armenia?It's not just fear, it's a fact. The current war is to drive the Armenians out of Nagorno-Karabakh. All this is being done by Azerbaijan on the pretext that these are Azerbaijani territories and that the Azeris are currently liberating their territories. It is also a fact that Armenians have already been expelled from the territory of the former USSR in the former Azerbaijan, except from Nagorno-Karabakh. This is due to the fact that the latter is under the protection of Armenian soldiers. The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is different from all other post-Soviet conflicts in that it is a war for life and death.;E
UA;Armenia surrender. Who's the main beneficiary of Karabakh truce?;"The latest developments around Nagorno-Karabakh were predictable and logical – in terms of behavior of both Turkey and Russia. Indeed, the Azerbaijani-Armenian war was in fact about the Turkey-Russia confrontation.Turkey ultimately won, having received for the first time in 75 years, since World War 2, the opportunity to influence the political situation in the South CaucasusRussians believe they won. However, in reality, this isn't the case. It's Turkey who ultimately won, having received for the first time in 75 years, since World War 2, the opportunity to influence the political situation in the South Caucasus. This is Turkey's main achievement. Moscow also prefers to not comment on the fact that Turkish observers will keep an eye on Russian peacekeepers in Karabakh.Anyway, Nagorno-Karabakh is returning under Azerbaijan's jurisdiction. At the same time, Russia maintains good relations with Azerbaijan as the Kremlin did not intervene in the conflict at this stage. Massively weakened both politically and militarily, Armenia will be forced to ""bow down"" to Russia begging for salvation, and the latter is likely to show some love in capacity of an ""elder sister."" And all political blame for the surrender will of course be put on Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan. In fact, Pashinyan has already taken all blame upon himself. Therefore, most likely, a change in the political leadership is imminent, and Moscow will surely try to plant a loyal successor, pushing for the return to power of Sargsyan's party, the so-called ""party of war."" At the same time, Russia will get yet another enclave, this time in the shape of an entire Armenia, where it will strengthen its military presence, deploying more troops, as well as further determine Armenia's foreign and domestic policies.Turkey gets a land corridor to Azerbaijan, which no one will controlHowever, Turkey will still receive the greatest preferences. Despite the fact that the Russian peacekeeping contingent will be stationed in Nagorno-Karabakh, it will stay within its borders. The Lachin corridor is only 5 km wide. The number of peacekeepers and hardware is clearly regulated: 1,920 soldiers, 90 armored personnel carriers, and 380 vehicles. These forces pose no major military threat to Azerbaijan. The financial costs of maintaining the peacekeeping contingent, however, shall be borne by Russia. They will also have to fund construction of a new bypass road around Shusha, as well as restore Armenian economy, affected by military measures, primarily, mobilization. All this will be Russian money.Turkey could use this land corridor, among other things, for laying oil and gas pipes from Central AsiaSo what Russia got is yet another ""headache.""At the same time, Turkey receives a land corridor to Azerbaijan, which no one will control. Russia will be responsible for ensuring security of this corridor: Russian border guards will be obliged to protect the area from provocations. I suggest Turkey will ultimately use this land corridor, including for laying oil and gas pipes from Central Asia running via Azerbaijan to Turkey. This is Erdogan's old strategy of turning Turkey into a southern gas and oil hub. Not only is Erdogan resolving the issue by bypassing the Russian territory – Russians will also have to guard the corridor... In the meantime, Turkish observers will closely monitor the way Russia fulfills its obligations in terms of ensuring peace in the region.So no matter how long that Armenia prepares for a revanche, but as long as there are Russian peacekeepers there, Yerevan's dream of returning Nagorno-Karabakh by force will be impossible to realize.But why did Russia ""surrender"" Armenia? First, Pashinyan didn't come to power at Putin's behest. Pashinyan is a protégé of Gazprom. Putin's man is Serzh Sargsyan, representing the so-called Karabakh Clan.Russia, apparently, decided to ""kill all birds with one stone""Secondly, the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh was at an impasse. Over the past couple of years, Ilham Aliyev, with Turkey's support, had increasingly been demanding from Russia a clear ""road map"" for Azerbaijan to regain control of Nagorno-Karabakh. The first alarm bell rang in 2016 when a ""four-day war"" erupted, but Armenia did not draw no conclusions whatsoever.So, Russia, apparently, decided to ""kill all birds with one stone"": to maintain good relations with Azerbaijan, allowing them to conquer Karabakh, to retain normal ties with Turkey, to get a weakened Armenia in order to deploy troops there, i.e. to strengthen own military presence. Also, Russia got the opportunity to ensure the change in Armenia's political leadership.Russians forgot the most important thing: Turks will now monitor them closelyHowever, everything turned out as in Dante's Divine Comedy, when God told who would watch out for whom. So, the Russians forgot the most important thing: Turks will now monitor them closely. So who is the main beneficiary of this whole campaign then? It's Turkey and Azerbaijan.In fact, Turkey, with the hands of the Russian Federation, will henceforth be in control of the situation in the South Caucasus.";A
BH;Foreign Ministry invites BiH Citizens to leave Conflict-affected Regions;The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Bosnia and Herzegovina does not recommend traveling to Azerbaijan due to the escalation of the conflict between that country and Armenia, in the area of Nagorno-Karabakh, said the head of the Public Relations Office of this ministry, Nebojsa Regoje stated on Tuesday.The recommendation for BiH citizens, who are currently in war-torn regions, is to leave immediately. The Consulate General of BiH in Istanbul is responsible for the consular protection of BiH citizens, and the telephone number is + / 90 212 / 236-69-34. For all additional clarifications and instructions, BiH citizens can contact the BiH Embassy in Ankara.The President of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, signed a decree declaring a state of emergency in the entire country, starting on September 28th. Military mobilization was announced and a state of war was declared in several regions, after Armenia declared total military mobilization.The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is an ethnic and territorial conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh and seven surrounding districts, which are de facto controlled by the self-declared Republic of Artsakh, but are internationally recognized as de jure part of Azerbaijan. The conflict has its origins in the early 20th century. Under the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin decided to make the Nagorno-Karabakh region an autonomous oblast of Soviet Azerbaijan.The present conflict began in 1988, when the Karabakh Armenians demanded that Karabakh be transferred from Soviet Azerbaijan to Soviet Armenia. The conflict escalated into a full-scale war in the early 1990s.A ceasefire signed in 1994 provided for two decades of relative stability, which significantly deteriorated along with Azerbaijan’s increasing frustration with the status quo, at odds with Armenia’s efforts to cement it. A four-day escalation in April 2016 became the deadliest ceasefire violation to date.;N

The ceasefire has been broken again.The conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan has been going on for decades, but it was at the end of September that fighting began anew.On Saturday last week, the countries agreed on a ceasefire during a meeting in Moscow with Russia as a mediator, but on the same day there were reports that it had been broken and in the evening seven powerful explosions were heard. Both parties have blamed each other for violating the agreement, AFP reported.Bloodiest fighting since the region broke freeThe Ombudsman for Human Rights in Karabakh, Artak Beglaryan, wrote on Twitter after Friday's bombings:""Azerbaijan just struck Stepanakert with heavy missiles for the first time today. They continue to attack civilian points while international communities continue with empty words and statements.""Earlier on Friday, Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev said the army had ""liberated"" several villages, on Twitter.Armenia and Azerbaijan both make historic claims to Nagorno-Karabakh, which today formally belongs to Azerbaijan – but the majority of the inhabitants are Armenians.

LT;Nagorno-Karabakh declares it has lost control of the strategically important city of Shush;"The Nagorno-Karabakh region of the South Caucasus has admitted to losing control of the strategically important city of Shush. The city is no longer controlled by Nagorno-Karabakh, Vagram Pogosian, a spokesman for the regional leadership, said on Monday.As early as Sunday, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev announced that his forces had recaptured the city. Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh initially denied this. Shusha is considered to be the most important city. The authorities in Nagorno-Karabakh themselves have announced that its loss will ultimately mean a defeat in the fight for the whole region. Nagorno-Karabakh leadership has also acknowledged that Azerbaijani units are located near the capital, Stepanakert. Aliyev said victory in the conflict with Armenia was imminent. He also announced on Monday that Azerbaijani forces had taken control of 23 more locations. V. Pogosian, a spokesman for the Nagorno-Karabakh leadership, wrote on Facebook: “Unfortunately, we are haunted by failures. We have completely lost control of the city of Šuša. The enemy stands at Stepanakert. Now our existence is in danger. ""Armenian prime minister: fighting over city continues Armenian prime minister Nicholas Pashian said on Monday that fighting over the important Nagorno-Karabakh city of Shushah continues, although Azerbaijan announced the day before that its forces had occupied the city.If Shusha really went to Azerbaijan, it would be an important victory achieved six weeks after the start of new fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh. However, Pasinyan wrote on the social network Facebook that ""the struggle for Shushi continues"", using the Armenian name of the city. Vachram Poghosian, a spokesman for the Armenian-backed separatist leader of Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian enclave that separated from Azerbaijan in the 1990s, wrote earlier on Facebook that Armenian forces had lost control of Shushah. Located at the epicenter of the battle, the city of strategic importance is about 15 km from the enclave’s largest city, Stepanakert, and near the main road connecting with Armenia. ""We have to admit that we are still haunted by a chain of failures and that we have no control over the city of Shushi,"" Poghosian said. ""The enemy is on the outskirts of Stepanakert, and the capital's existence is already in jeopardy.""";A
DE;Armenia-Azerbaijan prisoner swap begins;"The neighboring countries are allowing prisoners from each side return home as part of an ""all for all"" deal. The prisoners were taken during intense fighting over the contested Nagorno-Karabakh region.A prisoner-swap between neighbors Armenia and Azerbaijan kicked off on Monday, Azerbaijan has confirmed.The exchange began a just about a month after a Russian-brokered cease-fire began, following deadly clashes that broke out in late September over the contested Nagorno-Karabakh region.Officials in Azerbaijan's capital city Baku listed two prisoners who had been returned to Azerbaijan.Returns began under an ""agreement... on the exchange of prisoners and hostages on an 'all for all' basis,"" according to Azerbaijan's State Commission on Prisoners of War, Hostages and Missing Persons in a statement on Monday.It is not known how many prisoners will be exchanged in total.Armenia has recently accused Azerbaijan of delaying the start of the transfer.What is going on between Armenia and Azerbaijan?The Caucasus countries have for decades been engaged in a simmering conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh.The enclave is inhabited largely by ethnic Armenians but is officially part of Azerbaijan. It broke away from Baku in a 1990s war which claimed some 30,000 lives.The fighting that broke out in September has seen the heaviest clashes since a 1994 truce. Around 5,000 people were killed on both sides during this six-week conflict.A cease-fire was eventually brokered by Russia on November 10.The peace deal allowed Baku to reclaim control over vast swathes of Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding lands previously held by Armenian forces.It prompted protests in Armenia calling for Prime Minister Nikola Pashinyan to step down. Pashinyan described the deal as necessary to prevent Baku from taking over the whole of Nagorno-Karabakh.But the deal has not entirely put an end to the violence: both countries have accused the other of violating the cease-fire.Russia, which has deployed peacekeepers to Nagorno-Karabakh to monitor the peace accord, has confirmed this.Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev warned that Armenia ''shouldn't try to start it all over again.''";N
BE;Nearly 5000 have died in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Putin says;The number of people who have died since the resumption of hostilities between Azerbaijan and Armenian separatists in Nagorno-Karabakh “is nearly 5,000,” Russian President Vladimir Putin said.“According to our information, the number of deaths on both sides is about 2,000, which means the total number is nearly 5,000 dead,” Putin said at a discussion forum shown live on television.Since 27 September, Azerbaijani forces have recaptured territory over which Baku had lost control since a war that broke out in the 1990s in the wake of the fall of the USSR. Some 30,000 people died in that war, which resulted in the secession of the region, inhabited almost entirely by Armenians.According to partial results, the fresh fighting has claimed close to 1,000 lives, including about 100 civilians. However, each side also claims to have killed thousands of adversaries.Russia, the main regional power, has good relations with both camps. Putin said he was in permanent contact with Azerbaijan’s President, Ilham Aliyev, and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pachinian.Putin said on Thursday that the conflict was at its worst.According to the Russian president, the war originated from a “territorial struggle” and an “ethnic conflict”. He said Moscow understood that such a situation, in which an important chunk of Azerbaijanian territory was lost, could not continue.On Wednesday, Armenia said there could be no “diplomatic solution” to the conflict, against the background of vain efforts by the international community to negotiate a lasting ceasefire.Two recent humanitarian truces brokered by Russia both collapsed.Armenian and Azerbaijani diplomatic chiefs had separate meetings in Washington with their U.S. counterpart, Mike Pompeo on Friday.EU positionEU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell met Armenia’s President Armen Sarkissian in Brussels last week and discussed the situation in and around the Nagorno Karabakh conflict zone.

IR;Death toll in clashes between Armenia and Azerbaijan reaches around 600;"The reported death toll in clashes between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces over the separatist territory of Nagorno-Karabakh has reached around 600. Nagorno-Karabakh military officials said 16 more of their servicemen had been killed in fighting today, bringing total number of dead among military members to 532 since September 27, when the fighting started. Azerbaijan has not disclosed its military losses, and the overall toll is likely to be much higher with both sides regularly claiming to have inflicted significant military casualties on one another. Azerbaijani authorities said 42 civilians have been killed on their side in over two weeks. Nagorno-Karabakh human rights ombudsman Artak Beglaryan reported at least 31 civilian deaths in the breakaway region late yesterday. Hundreds more have been wounded. The recent fighting between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces broke out on September 27. More than two weeks of deadly clashes marked the biggest escalation of a decades-old conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, which lies in Azerbaijan but has been under control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since the end of a separatist war in 1994. Both sides have repeatedly accused each other of attacks amid appeals from around the globe to end the hostilities and start peace talks. Armenian and Azerbaijani foreign ministers signed a ceasefire deal last week. The truce that took effect on Saturday was brokered by Russia, which has a security pact with Armenia. But Moscow has also cultivated warm ties with Azerbaijan and seeks to mediate in the conflict. The truce, however, has been immediately challenged with both Armenia and Azerbaijan accusing each other of continued attacks in violation of the agreement. Today, Azerbaijani officials have once again accused Armenian forces of shelling some of its regions, and Nagorno-Karabakh officials said Azerbaijan launched ""large-scale military operations"" along the front line. Russia and the European Union have urged both sides to observe the ceasefire.";N

UK;Nagorno-Karabakh peace deal reshapes regional geopolitics;The Russian-brokered ceasefire deal in Nagorno-Karabakh will empower both Moscow and Ankara as the new kingmakers in the South Caucasus, analysts said, redrawing security guarantees between Armenia and Azerbaijan with the conspicuous absence of the west. As in the conflicts in Libya and Syria, Russia and Turkey have once again found themselves backing opposing sides, and used their sway on local players to negotiate for peace deals that guarantee their own influence. “There’s an absolutely new geopolitical configuration,” said Fyodor Lukyanov, an influential political expert close to the Kremlin. That configuration eschews France and the United States, which along with Russia had formed the OSCE Minsk Group and hosted talks since a key 1994 ceasefire that ended a bloody war between Armenia and Azerbaijan. But the OSCE Minsk Group played little role in negotiating an end to the 2020 war, as the United States had appeared distracted under President Trump, was left off of initial communiques calling for an end to the violence. Meanwhile, Turkish support for Azerbaijan helped launch a six-week offensive that had captured Shusha, a strategically-placed city in Nagorno-Karabakh, and was threatening the region’s largest city of Stepanakert until Russia stepped in with peacekeepers. “The Minsk group basically doesn’t exist anymore,” said Lukyanov, calling Turkey an “important part of the equation”. “The military defeat of Armenia means that the previous status quo is impossible to restore. That means that the Russian role as a guarantor of stability is highly demanded by both sides.” Early on Tuesday morning, the first of nearly 2,000 Russian peacekeepers deployed toward the Lachin corridor, a lifeline between mainland Armenia and Stepanakert, the largest city in Nagorno-Karabakh. Under the accord announced signed by Armenia and Azerbaijan, Russian troops will guard the corridor for five years. The future for Stepanakert looks dim, said Laurence Broers, the Caucasus programme director at Conciliation Resources, a peace-building group, adding that “maybe the calculation is that it’s going to be such an awful place to live that most of the Armenian population – most of whom have already left – won’t come back”. The mission is arguably Russia’s greatest intervention into the region since the 2008 Georgia war. Russia had resisted a peacekeeping role for weeks until it became clear that Azerbaijan was threatening to capture the whole of Nagorno-Karabakh. “The idea was to let the Azeris win but not completely,” said Lukyanov. Under the agreement, Azerbaijan will retain control of the land it has captured during the war and retake territories outside of Nagorno-Karabakh under Armenian control. Already on Tuesday there were signs of both sides jockeying to spin the peace deal. The Azerbaijan president, Ilham Aliyev, said that both Russian and Turkish peacekeepers would be deployed to Nagorno-Karabakh, shocking many Armenians. Russia quickly intervened, highlighting that Turkey was not an official partner to the peace agreement. “Not a single word is said about this in the published statement,” Dmitri Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told reporters on Tuesday. “The sides did not agree on that. The presence of Turkish soldiers in Karabakh was not coordinated.” Turkey’s influence on the conflict has been well documented, as Ankara sold crucial drone technology to Azerbaijan, and Turkish security firms contracted with rebel fighters from Idlib to travel to Azerbaijan and fight on the front lines of the conflict. And the opening of a direct link between Azerbaijan and its exclave of Nakhchivan, which borders Turkey, would create a land route from Turkey to mainland Azerbaijan. All eyes will now be on the Russian peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh, who are the key to maintaining a fragile ceasefire. Broers said that the Russian peacekeepers could “look like a colonising force”. “To go into a peacekeeping operation without a political process that could deliver a peace agreement basically means you’re there for good,” he said. “What’s been created now is an inherently unstable situation. That peacekeeping contingent will be vulnerable to provocations.”;N
ES;The three residents of Lloret who have gone to war;"The same day the war broke out, Armen Knyazyan boarded a plane for Armenia. Knyazyan was a well-known restaurant entrepreneur in Lloret de Mar (La Selva). Inflated with patriotism but without military training - with limited gun control thanks to his fondness for hunting - the 46-year-old Armenian traveled to his home country on September 27 to fight in Nagorno-Karabakh. . The region, disputed between Armenia and Azerbaijan, is the scene of a new war to which thousands of Armenians living abroad have joined. Knyazyan died on October 10 from a drone attack.Knyazyan was buried on October 17 in Lloret, according to the Diari de Girona. The coffin was covered with the flag of Artsakh, the Armenian-majority republic in Upper Karabakh. Artsakh was a self-proclaimed independent country - without United Nations recognition - in the wake of the war between Armenia and Azerbaijan between 1988 and 1994. The region has been formally part of Azerbaijan since the Soviet era. . When it disintegrated, the clash between the two communities in the territory was unleashed. Artsakh President Araik Arutiunian has awarded the posthumous medal as a national hero to Knyazyan. Arutiunian explained in a statement that he had met the Lloret businessman in 2016, during the so-called “four-day war”, the previous war escalation that took place in Upper Karabakh. His daughter, Marianna Knyazyan, explains that her father was visiting Armenia in those days and when the conflagration broke out, he did not hesitate and went to Artsakh to help his compatriots. Knyazyan on this occasion did not hesitate either. He died when a drone attacked the vehicle in which he was traveling. Marianna believes that the Azeri army targeted him because he was accompanying a prominent Armenian soldier.Armen is not the only member of the Knyazyan family who left Lloret to join the war. A cousin of his, the Sarkis, has settled in the Armenian capital, Yerevan, to take in refugees from the conflict zone: another cousin, Norik, a cook in a restaurant in this village on the Costa Brava, has been accepted by the army at the front because he had done military service. The Armenian embassy in Madrid reports that ten Armenians residing in Spain have traveled to their country of origin to participate in one way or another in the fight. ""More than 200 Armenians in Spain have contacted the embassy in order to convey their availability to travel to Artsakh when necessary,"" said a spokeswoman for the delegation.Armen Knyazyan leaves three children and a wife. Marianna admits that the three brothers have at some point thought of taking part in the war, she from Yerevan helping logistically and the two men at the front line of the battle. ""Fighting for the homeland is an example for us, but my mother and I would not allow them to leave, we do not want more losses to the family. In addition, they do not have any military experience or know the place.The Knyazyans arrived in Lloret de Mar in 2000 from Germany. A friend of Armen's suggested to him that he could find work in the village. They were among the first Armenians to settle in the municipality - now there are more than 200. He started as a waiter and progressed to own three restaurants, the best known being the Italian Giorgio. Another referent of the local Armenian community is Samuel Badalyan, a high-ranking ex-military man in the war with Azerbaijan following Soviet disintegration. Badalyan is part of the veteran volunteer units fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh. In Spain he has dedicated himself to the business of private security and is the founder of the Armenian Cultural Association of Lloret.

GE;"Trenin: ""The Armenians Will Have to Eat their Bitter Humble Pie"" & Georgia Draw Lessons";The second Karabakh War is seemingly over, and as one side celebrates and another mourns, experts, opinion makers and their ilk are trying to gauge what the Kremlin-brokered, Erdogan-approved truce might bring. How will the power balance change in the region, who are the winners and losers, and, finally, what impact will it have on Georgia? These are the topics GEORGIA TODAY put to one of the Moscow Carnegie Center's most prominent faces, Dmitri Trenin.By far the most important and basic question is how does this new deal change the power balance in the region?It establishes a new balance in the region, a new regional order if you like, which is supported by two of three principal powers outside the region: one is Russia, the other Turkey. I think this new order legitimizes Turkey's inclusion in the South Caucasus balance. Turkey has certainly increased its profile in the South Caucasus, while Russia has reconfigured its role in the region, becoming the one power that can act as a mediator between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Turkey will not be able to perform that role. Then again, we have to realize that Moscow is no longer the dominant power in the South Caucasus, has not been for a long time now, in fact, and I don't think Moscow will recover that position. Azerbaijan will be very much aligned with Turkey, Armenia is under a question mark, but Russia has rediscovered its role as the only power that is accepted both in Yerevan and Baku, and that provides it with potent leverage. Let us not forget that Russia is very worried about the stability of the of the northern Caucasus, an area where it fears, should the war in Karabakh continue, there will be more jihadis, more outsiders from outside the region who come to Karabakh and stay in the Caucasus. An influx of jihadis from outside the region would be bitter irony for Russia- to have fought the jihadists in Syria only to see them much closer to home.Why did Russia remain so inactive and only now manage to broker a truce? Was it premeditated?I would disagree that Russia played a waiting game to mediate a truce between Armenia and Azerbaijan. They tried to broker a truce exactly a month ago, when the situation was very different, and no-one can say that it was a pro-forma exercise. I think the motivation of the Russian side was to stop the conflict as soon as possible. My chief argument is that Russia cares more about the northern Caucasus than it does about the southern.A counter argument to that would be that genuine ceasefires brokered by Russia are not usually violated in 7 hours, as happened here. This new one does not look like it will be violated anytime soon.No, because continuation of the war would lead to the utter and complete defeat of Armenia, very likely the total banishment of Armenians from Karabakh, and the total seizure of the entire territory by Azerbaijani forces. That is what essentially made the Armenian side agree to the ceasefire.Azerbaijan has been exercising this policy of strategic patience and militarization for 26 years, and it has been enjoying military superiority over Yerevan for more than a decade. Why act now?There was a confluence of several factors, one of which was the Turkish factor. Turkey played a major role and, as we know, in the months preceding the war, supplied Azerbaijan with lots of hardware, lots of expertise that the Azerbaijanis used in this war. It was also the time when the United States is distracted with its own election and then the transfer of power. Thirdly, President Aliyev benefited from Russia’s displeasure and distrust of Pashinyan and his government. He kept stressing in interviews with the Russian media “you have a Soros-appointed prime minister in Armenia who is not really your friend.” The moment was opportune for Aliyev. I think he decided to launch what they call a counter-offensive against the offensive that stopped 26 years ago.Do you see Russia using the peacekeepers, who will control the Lachine corridor, as a leverage to keep Armenia under its thumb?They will control the Lachine corridor, and that will give them leverage, no question about that. Russians are looking at their alliances, and one school of thought in Moscow is that “if people want our protection, they have to be good allies: they have to stand with us: they shouldn't be ashamed by being closer to us because you know you cannot expect Russia to bail you out and at the same time try to impress the West how pro-Western you are: you need to choose.” If Russia holds the keys to important Armenian positions, then it indeed has leverage, and if Armenians want to reject that kind of arrangement, they are free to do so as a separate country. The pro-Western part of Armenian society could ask themselves why the US hasn’t done more for them, and if the US is not available for whatever reason as your protector, then even though you may have reservations, you have to be a good and honest ally to Russia.Are we talking about alliances here, or vassalage?I don’t think the term vassalage belongs in today's world, it doesn't belong in an analytical vocabulary, it belongs in the vocabulary of calling names. Mr Putin calls European countries “American vassals.” What it means is that you have to be seriously and honestly friendly toward Russia: have a genuine, sincere alliance with Russia. It's more like a wedding: if you wed somebody, it doesn't mean that you are somebody's vassal, but it certainly means that there are certain rules to be observed, there are certain things that you will not do as long as you want to keep that marriage going. Of course, you can get out of that marriage, and even marry somebody else: it's a free choice.How is that different from creating the spheres of influence that are so derided today?Russia’s sphere of influence in reality is very small: it includes very close to Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Donbas. Russia is working very hard to reconfigure its relationship with Belarus as we speak, that's very important. What Belarus is being offered is not a sphere of influence, it's something different, it's very close to integration.What about Armenia? Will it remain Pro-Russian?Armenia is not a Russian sphere of influence. I think the Armenians will have to eat their humble pie, which is very bitter, and I think there's a tremendous disappointment. I hope that Armenia will use this: defeat is always an opportunity, as when you are defeated, you become self-critical. I hope it doesn't turn the Armenian political class into a bunch of revanchists.On to Turkey. How does its increased presence in the South Caucasus change things?I think we’re living in a world now in which regional powers are more empowered than ever. Turkey has not become the dominant power in the South Caucasus as a result of the second Karabakh War, but they have gained not only a foothold, but a legitimized presence with another great power. Moscow will have to take Ankara more into account, that's for sure. Moscow and Ankara are rivals, but they are also partners in a limited sense of the word. They managed to compete, and they managed to negotiate and reach deals, and it gives you a promise that Turkey and Russia will not clash. I hope that they don’t clash.After trying the diplomacy approach for 26 years without luck, Baku achieved what it wanted in month and half through military might. Will it lead onlookers to think this is the only way to get back what you think is rightfully yours in Post-Soviet conflicts?An interesting question. All supposedly frozen conflicts can unfreeze at some point, and this is something that I'm saying here to the Russian audience: watch Karabakh and come to the conclusion that other conflicts can suddenly unfreeze and then confront you with a real security issue. Here, I’m talking primarily about Transnistria, but also about others.There are also situations when Moscow itself unfreezes conflicts. Do you see Russia trying to unfreeze the conflicts in Georgia?I think Russia is satisfied today, having Abkhazia and South Ossetia as its military bases. Does Russia want more? I don't think so. I mean, Russia in 2008 could have sent its military into Tbilisi. They chose not to do that not because of the French or the Western efforts: they exercised restraint based on their calculus of the negatives that would have surely followed after the Russian military's entry into Tbilisi. in 2014, there were people who argued that Russia should not stop with Crimea and Donbas and should march on Kiev and keep Ukraine under control. I think Putin chose wisely not to do so. Even today, Russia could have sent forces into Belarus to prop up Lukashenko, but they didn't. There are certain things you can do, but you would rather not because the negatives of doing so far outweigh the positives.What are the negatives?In Georgia, Russia doesn't really need Georgia: it needs Abkhazia to protect Sochi, which is Russia's de facto third capital: with Georgia very friendly with the US and potentially an American base in the future, they would want to have some protection from that side. South Ossetia places the Russian military within an hour's drive of Tbilisi: it's like a gun to your temple. Russia doesn't need more. Does it want to fight to make Georgia…what? To make it another Armenia? There are so many people in Georgia who are anti-Russian, what would you do with them? Once you step into such a territory, it would require a massive infusion of capital and money. Russia doesn't have that money to spend on Georgia, and even with Abkhazia and South Ossetia there are issues. The empire that could afford that, glorious as it was for many Russians, is history.Does the Nakhichevan corridor which has been speculated, if it materializes, threaten Georgia's transit country status?I would doubt it would play a very important role. There will be a competitor to the transit lines that run through Georgia, yes, but I don't think Azerbaijan will place so much of its transit in the hands of the Russians who will patrol the corridor. The status of Georgia as a transit country is not in danger.Any other impact this second Karabakh war could have on Georgia?It’s a useful warning that it's better to have conflicts resolved diplomatically: I think it applies to Georgia. there are two things I’ll say: the Abkhaz would not want to live under Georgian rule, and I think that it applies vice versa: I don't think the Georgian people who live in Abkhazia are happy to live under Abkhaz rule. The second thing I think is true is that South Ossetia will never be a full-fledged state. In happier times, before the Russian-Georgian war. I often mused about the future status of South Ossetia as some sort of Andorra that is a separate state but both Spain and France regard it as part of its own territory and it can function, with three statuses merged into one. You can do these things, I mean, there's no limit to how resourceful diplomats can be.That would be a kind of marriage between Russia and Georgia?Yes. Whether that’s still on the cards is another question though. It’s something that perhaps needs to be given more thought.;N
SW;Swiss call for an end to violence in Nagorno-Karabakh;The Swiss foreign ministry has called for an immediate stop to the violence in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. It has also allocated CHF1 million ($1.1 million) to the humanitarian operations of the Geneva-based International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).“Attacks on the civilian population and civilian objects must cease. The parties to the conflict are called upon to comply with international humanitarian law,” the ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.The contribution was being made in response to an appeal by the ICRC, it said.“Furthermore, the ministry expresses Switzerland’s regret that the humanitarian ceasefires of October 10 and 17 have not been respected. It reiterates its call to the parties to the conflict to stop the violence and condemns the ongoing shelling of residential areas.”Observance of the principles of distinction and proportionality were paramount, it added. “This also means that cluster munitions must not be used, as such weapons do not make any distinction between civilians and combatants.”Will the United Nations soon be obsolete?Is the international order capable of meeting the enormous challenges facing states and societies around the world?The Swiss government said that it was only through peaceful means that a lasting solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict could be found. The foreign ministry therefore called on both parties to the conflict “to resume meaningful negotiations without delay or preconditions”.;N
UK;The situation in and around Nagorno-Karabakh: UK statement;The United Kingdom welcomed the most recent humanitarian ceasefire and we are once again deeply disappointed to see that it is not being respected.We strongly condemn the continued shelling of civilian areas. Continued reports of civilian casualties are a stark reminder of the impact that this conflict is having on innocent civilians. Our position is clear: targeting of civilian settlements is deplorable. We offer our condolences to those who have lost loved ones. Our thoughts are with those who have been displaced and whose lives are being affected.We call on both parties to respect the ceasefire and return swiftly to the negotiating table: recognising the fact that the continuing violence is having a significant impact on civilians.We urge the parties to allow the ICRC immediate access as they seek to facilitate return of prisoners of war and repatriate the remains of the deceased.The international community continues to make clear that there can be no military solution to the situation in and around Nagorno-Karabakh. We urge both parties to return to substantive negotiations under the auspices of the Minsk Group Co-Chairs. The Minsk Group is the primary format through which a settlement must be reached.Once again I would like to reiterate the UKs support for the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs in their role in mediating negotiations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.;N

BG;Nagorno-Karabakh: Armenians Burn Their Homes and Flee as They Become Refugees from the War;Thousands of ethnic Armenians are fleeing areas around Nagorno-Karabakh that are to be handed over to Azerbaijan as part of the recent peace deal.The disputed region is internationally recognised as Azerbaijan's, but has been run by ethnic Armenians since 1994.According to the agreement, Armenia must cede control of several districts by 15 November.Some ethnic Armenians are even destroying their own homes so no Azerbaijanis can move in.;E
IR;Thousands in Armenia protest against Nagorno-Karabakh ceasefire terms;Thousands of people gathered in the capital of Armenia to protest against the country’s agreement with Azerbaijan to halt weeks of fighting over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. The deal calls for the deployment of nearly 2,000 Russian peacekeepers and territorial concessions. Participants at the rally, which Armenia’s opposition parties promoted, demanded the resignation of the country’s prime minister, who signed the peace agreement along with the presidents of Azerbaijan and Russia. Some of the protesters in Yerevan clashed with police, and many were detained. The truce between the two ex-Soviet nations, brokered by Moscow and announced on Tuesday, came after significant advances by Azerbaijani forces that the Armenia-backed leader of Nagorno-Karabakh said made it impossible for his side to carry on. The agreement was celebrated in Azerbaijan, but it angered Armenians, who immediately took to the streets demanding that the pact be invalidated. Armenia and Azerbaijan have been locked in a conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh for decades. The region lies within Azerbaijan but has been under control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a separatist war there ended in 1994. Heavy fighting erupted in late September – the biggest escalation of the conflict in a quarter of a century – and has left hundreds, possibly thousands, dead. Several ceasefires announced over the past six weeks crumbled almost immediately, but the current agreement appeared to be holding, with neither side reporting any more fighting since it came into force. It came days after Azerbaijan pressed its offensive deeper into Nagorno-Karabakh and took control of the city of Shushi, which is strategically positioned on heights overlooking the regional capital of Stepanakert. Nagorno-Karabakh’s separatist leader, Arayik Harutyunyan, acknowledged Tuesday that “had the hostilities continued at the same pace, we would have lost all of Artsakh (an Armenian name for Nagorno-Karabakh) within days.” Armenian prime minister Nikol Pashinian said it was “extremely painful for me personally and for our people”, calling the situation a “catastrophe” and adding that he had no choice but to sign the peace agreement. The agreement calls for Armenia to turn over control of some areas its holds outside the borders of Nagorno-Karabakh. They include the Lachin region, which the main road leading from Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia passes through. The agreement calls for the road, the so-called Lachin Corridor, to remain open and to be protected by Russian peacekeepers. The deal also calls for transport links to be established through Armenia that would connect Azerbaijan and its western exclave of Nakhchivan, which is surrounded by Armenia, Iran and Turkey. Armenian opposition politicians on Wednesday called the agreement “treacherous” and demanded that Mr Pashinian step down. “We need to save Armenia and Artsakh from Pashinian,” Ishkhan Saghatelyan, member of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation – Dashnaktsutyun political party, said at a rally that drew up to 10,000 people.;N
IR;Armenian parliament besieged by protesters demanding PM’s resignation;Thousands of protesters have converged on Armenia’s parliament building to push for the resignation of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan over his handing of fighting with Azerbaijan. They are angry about a peace deal that ended six weeks of fighting over the separatist region of Nagorno-Karabakh but saw Azerbaijan take over wide areas that have been controlled by Armenian forces for more than a quarter of a century. Armenia’s opposition parties gave Mr Pashinyan an ultimatum to resign by Tuesday, but he has ignored the demand, defending the peace deal as a bitter but necessary move that prevented Azerbaijan from overrunning the entire Nagorno-Karabakh region. About 15,000 protesters marched through Yerevan to the parliament building, chanting “Nikol go away”. The opposition has been pushing for Mr Pashinyan’s resignation since the Russia-brokered peace deal took effect on November 10. Protests have grown over the past days, with demonstrators blocking traffic in various sections of the capital, and also rallying in other cities. The Armenian Apostolic Church and all three of the country’s former presidents have joined the demand for Mr Pashinyan to step down. Undeterred, the prime minister told MPs in parliament that the nation needs consolidation in the current difficult period. “Voices of different groups mustn’t be mistaken for the people’s voice,” he said. Nagorno-Karabakh lies within Azerbaijan but has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a separatist war there ended in 1994. That war left Nagorno-Karabakh itself and substantial surrounding territory in Armenian hands. In 44 days of fighting that began in late September and left more than 5,600 people killed on both sides, the Azerbaijani army forged deep into Nagorno-Karabakh, forcing Armenia to accept the peace deal that saw Azerbaijan reclaim much of the separatist region along with surrounding areas. Azerbaijanis have celebrated it as a major victory, and the country is set to hold a massive military parade on Thursday – to be attended by visiting Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Turkey strongly backed Azerbaijan during the conflict, which it used to expand its influence in the region.;E

AT;Nagorno-Karabakh: Turkey wants to monitor ceasefire with Russia;"Together with Russia, Turkey wants to ensure compliance with the ceasefire in Nagorno-Karabakh. A Russian delegation is therefore expected in Turkey on Friday, said Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Cavusoglu on Thursday in Baku, according to reports from Turkish broadcasters. According to him, both sides want to discuss the creation of a joint observatory for the ceasefire agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan.The warring neighboring states of Armenia and Azerbaijan agreed on the ceasefire in Nagorno-Karabakh on Tuesday night after weeks of heavy fighting. The agreement was signed by Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia - Turkey's role is not explicitly mentioned in the written agreement.However, Turkey, which is assisting Azerbaijan in the conflict, expects to be involved in monitoring the agreement and refers to an agreement reached on Wednesday by defense ministers on both sides.Once the observatory is set up, it will use drones and other means to ""fully control"" what is happening in Nagorno-Karabakh, ""whether there are violations or not,"" said Cavusoglu in Baku. He hoped that Armenia ""learned from its mistakes"". If Armenia breaks the agreement, it will ""pay the price,"" added Cavusoglu.Arrests in ArmeniaIn the course of the protests against the ceasefire agreement, prominent government critics were arrested on Thursday. The public prosecutor announced that ten opposition activists had been arrested for organizing ""illegal, violent mass unrest"". The arrests came a few hours before critics wanted to demonstrate against the agreement again in Yerevan.The police arrested several demonstrators in Yerevan on Wednesday after thousands of people had gathered for protests in the center of the Armenian capital. Among them were the head of the opposition party in Bloom Armenia, Gagik Zarukian, and Ischchan Sagateian from the party Armenian Revolutionary Federation. They face up to ten years imprisonment. The protesters protest against the ceasefire agreement and demand the resignation of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian.The agreement reached under Russian mediation stipulates that both warring parties may keep the areas in which they currently have control - for Armenia this means major territorial losses. Azerbaijan had conquered 15 to 20 percent of Nagorno-Karabakh territory in the course of the fighting with the pro-Armenian troops.To control the ceasefire, Russia announced the dispatch of around 2,000 soldiers and hundreds of army vehicles to the front lines. The first 414 Russian soldiers and dozens of army vehicles are already in Nagorno-Karabakh, according to the military on Wednesday. Among other things, they are supposed to secure a corridor that connects the Lachin district in Nagorno-Karabakh with the Armenian national territory.The self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic is still not recognized internationally and is considered part of Azerbaijan under international law. Most of it is inhabited by Armenians. The fighting over the region, which had been controversial for decades, broke out again at the end of September. According to both sides, more than a thousand people have been killed since then.";A
BE;Nagorno-Karabakh: Armenians block Belgian motorways to protest escalating conflict;Traffic on several Belgian motorways was at a standstill on Friday morning as protesters staged blockades in an effort to draw attention to an escalating armed conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan.The demonstration was led by Armenian protesters who, wrapped in their national flags, spread through the E17, E19 and E314 motorways and disrupted traffic at key border crossings into Belgium.“They walked onto the highway and stopped traffic,” Peter Bruyninckx, spokesperson for the Flemish Traffic Centre told Het Nieuwsblad.Protesters in Rekkem, located in the province of West Flanders along the border with France, blocked traffic coming from both directions.In Maasmechelen, near the Dutch border, traffic was blocked for all vehicles driving into Belgium while in Meer, drivers going in the direction of the Netherlands were blocked by the demonstration.Police were able to clear 27 cars blocking the motorway in Maasmechelen as they began causing traffic jams lasting up to half an hour. The demonstrators were led to a nearby gas station.“The demonstrators want to talk to the press to bring the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan to their attention,” a police officer in Maasmechelen told the outlet.The protest comes three weeks into an armed conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan that erupted around three weeks ago over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian enclave in the territory of Azerbaijan.Over 300 people have already died as hostilities continue, with the collapse of a Russian-brokered ceasefire leading to fears that the armed dispute could escalate into a wider regional conflict at the doorstep of Europe.Azerbaijan and Armenia have continued accusing each other of causing the flare-up in violence, with the president of Azerbaijan —which has received unconditional backing from Turkey, a regional heavyweight hostile to Armenia— saying that “whoever fired first should stop first.”The Nagorno-Karabakh, located inside Azerbaijan but run by ethnic Armenians, has been a source of conflict since the collapse of the Soviet UnionSeveral similar demonstrations were staged in highways elsewhere in Europe, with demonstrators blocking borders crossings in Spain, France, Switzerland or Germany.;N
UK;The Syrian mercenaries used as 'cannon fodder' in Nagorno-Karabakh;"Turkey and Azerbaijan deny that Syrian mercenaries were used in the recent offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh but four Syrians have told the BBC that after enlisting for sentry duties in Azerbaijan, they were unexpectedly thrown into battle on the front line. It was back in August of this year that the rumours started to circulate in rebel-held areas of northern Syria: there was well-paid work to be had overseas. ""I had a friend who told me that there is a very good job you can do, just to be at military checkpoints in Azerbaijan,"" one man told me. ""They told us our mission would be to serve as sentries on the border - as peacekeepers. They were offering $2,000 a month! It felt like a fortune for us,"" said another, whom I will call Qutaiba. Both applied for the job through Turkish-backed rebel factions that make up what's known as the Syrian National Army, a force in northern Syria opposed to President Bashar al-Assad. In an area where few earn more than $1 a day, the promised salary seemed like a godsend. It's estimated that somewhere between 1,500 and 2,000 men signed up and travelled to Azerbaijan, via Turkey, on Turkish military transport aircraft. But the work wasn't what it seemed. The men, many of them with no military experience, were being recruited for war - as they soon discovered when they were taken to the front line and ordered to fight. ""I didn't expect to survive,"" Qutaiba says. ""It seemed like a 1% chance. Death was all around us."" Short presentational grey line Nagorno-Karabakh is a disputed enclave that fell under Armenian control during a bloody conflict that ended in a ceasefire in 1994. Tens of thousands died and hundreds of thousands were displaced, both from the enclave itself and from surrounding territory occupied by Armenian forces. The international community has not recognised the self-declared Republic of Artsakh (the Armenian name for Nagorno-Karabakh) and this year, sensing its growing military superiority, Azerbaijan decided to go on the attack. Although Azerbaijan and its ally Turkey deny the use of mercenaries, researchers have amassed a considerable amount of photographic evidence, drawn from videos and photographs the fighters have posted online, which tells a different story. The Syrians seem to have been deployed on the southern flank of the Azeri advance, where casualties on both sides were extremely high. The fighters I spoke to came under heavy fire and seemed to have been traumatised by their experiences. They didn't want to be identified, for fear of reprisal from militia commanders, so I have given them different names. ""My first battle began the day after I arrived,"" says Ismael. ""I and about 30 guys were sent to the front line. We walked for about 50m when suddenly a rocket landed near us. I threw myself to the ground. The shelling lasted for 30 minutes non-stop. Those minutes felt like years. It was then I regretted coming to Azerbaijan."" ""We didn't know what to do, how to react,"" says Samir, who adds that he and many of his fellow recruits had virtually no military experience or training. ""I saw men dying, and others who just went crazily running. They didn't have any sense of where they were going, because they were basically civilians."" All of the men say they were given little protective equipment or medical support. Many of their fellow fighters appear to have bled to death from wounds that battlefield medics could easily have treated. ""The hardest moment was when one of my mates was hit,"" says Ismael, who was himself later hospitalised with shrapnel wounds. ""He was 20m away from me when the shell landed. I saw him fall. He was calling to me, screaming. But his spot was exposed to the Armenian machine guns. I couldn't help him. In the end, he just died there."" Another Syrian says he was paralysed by fear when the shelling started. ""I remember I just sat on the ground and cried and my injured friends started to cry as well,"" he says. ""One guy got shrapnel in his head. He died right there... Every day I see this. When it comes to me, I sit and cry, even now. I don't know how I survived this war."" Estimates vary as to the exact death toll among the Syrian fighters. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based group that monitors the conflict in Syria, puts the figure at more than 500. This compares to reported figures of more than 2,400 on the Armenian side, and nearly 3,000 on Azerbaijan's side, though Azerbaijan doesn't acknowledge that any Syrians were among them. ""We don't use mercenaries,"" the country's president, Ilham Aliyev, told the France 24 news network in October. ""This is our official statement and since the outbreak not a single country presented evidence of that. And moreover we don't need that. We have an army of more than 100,000 fighters and what we are doing now on the ground demonstrates that our army is capable of liberating its lands itself."" This is an interesting point. Why would Azerbaijan recruit Syrian fighters? Military analyst Michael Kofman, head of the Russia programme at the CNA military research centre in Washington DC, says the goal seems to have been to minimise Azeri troop casualties. ""They took quite a few casualties early on, especially in the south-east, and these mercenaries were essentially used as expendable assault troops to go in the first wave,"" he says. ""They calculated quite cynically that if it turned out these offensives were not successful early on, then it was best these casualties would be among mercenaries not Azerbaijani forces. 'Nobody cares about mercenaries."" Elizabeth Tsurkov, a fellow at the Centre for Global Policy, also in Washington DC, who has spoken to dozens of Syrians who took part in the conflict, agrees that they were ""used as cannon fodder"". ""They're cheap. They can be rushed to the front line with very little preparation, as was the case in Azerbaijan - essentially people to whom you can strap a Kalashnikov and tell, 'Go capture that hill, go capture that forest,'"" she says. And, she points out, they are desperately poor, ""so they are willing to go and risk their lives"". However, within a few days of the outbreak of the fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh, in late September, hundreds were laying down weapons and refusing to fight. Two of those I spoke to were among them, and one sent a video of the strikers outside the barracks where they were stationed. ""The commanders started to threaten us that they'd put us in jail in Azerbaijan for nine months. Then they told us that even when we got back to Syria, they'd arrest us,"" says Samir. ""But there were 500 of us on strike at that point and we did start to have an effect on them. They put together a list of our names. Then five or six days later they came and told us to get ourselves ready: 'You are leaving.'"" Samir says that none of these men were paid a penny of the $2,000 they had been promised, and many did not get back the personal possessions they had arrived with in Azerbaijan. He also claims that on their return to Syria, commanders of a rebel faction summarily killed four men accused of organising the strike. The BBC has been unable to verify this allegation. Nagorno-Karabakh is not the first conflict in which Syrian fighters have been recruited to serve recently. Allegedly through Russian and Turkish-backed security firms, Syrians from both the rebel and government-held areas have been fighting in the civil war in Libya for the last year or more - and on different sides. A mercenary representing the internationally recognised Libyan government forces, supported by Turkey, told me he'd personally participated in the capture of former pro-Assad Syrian soldiers when driving back Russian-backed forces loyal to Gen Khalifa Haftar. Turkey has acknowledged that Syrian fighters are present in Libya, though has not admitted recruiting them. ""We are not sending fighters to Libya. We have deep historical and close kinship ties to Libya and we want to see a political solution and in Libya now there is a chance for peace and talks,"" Turkey's ambassador to London, Umit Yalcin, told me. When I mentioned what the Syrian fighters had told me about Turkey's role in recruiting them to fight in Nagorno-Karabakh, he echoed Azerbaijan's official denials. ""Of course these claims are baseless and not helpful in terms of achieving justice and peace and stability,"" he said. ""We should focus on the deal for peace and justice in the region."" He also alleged that Kurdish mercenaries had been fighting on the Armenian side - a claim Armenia has rejected. Calling on 11 November for mercenaries in the conflict zone to be withdrawn, UN human rights experts said widespread reports indicated that Turkey had engaged in large-scale recruitment and transfer of Syrian men to Azerbaijan. At the same time, they said they were looking into reports that Armenia had been involved in the deployment of foreign nationals to fight in the conflict. Today, a Russian-brokered ceasefire is in operation in Nagorno-Karabakh. Under its terms, Azerbaijan has reclaimed a significant proportion of the land it lost in the 1990s. Military analysts say that it was above all its superiority in the air, using Israeli and Turkish drone technology, that enabled Azerbaijan to achieve the victory it now claims. Meanwhile, back in Syria, two of the mercenaries are trying to put the experience behind them. ""I feel guilty for becoming a mercenary. I feel ashamed,"" says Samir, even though he refused to fight after just three days on the front line. ""When people ask me, 'Did I travel?' I say no - even though they know that I went. I feel like I am very small in their eyes… When I got there I did say no to war. I objected to what was happening. But I'm ashamed because I trusted the mercenaries. That's why I feel shame."" This month there are unconfirmed reports in Syrian media of a new recruitment drive in government-controlled areas. It's suggested that former pro-Assad soldiers have been signed up, through Russian intermediaries, to guard ""oil installations"" in Venezuela, on the promise of generous salaries. The BBC has not been able independently to confirm these claims. But Elizabeth Tsurkov says that, if true, it would follow a familiar pattern. ""The problem is Syria is so destroyed, the economy is so destroyed, that any actor wishing to recruit fighters on the cheap can find them in Syria,"" she says. ""You know, this is a population that has suffered immensely - displacement, chemical weapons, starvation, sieges, extermination in prisons - and now Syrians are basically just accepting the logic of an international community that does not value their lives and sees them as pawns."" I ask Samir what he would say to fellow Syrians tempted by similar offers of work abroad. ""I'd tell them you'll lose everything, even your dignity. You won't get anything and you might lose your life. Even if you are poor, being desperate here in Syria is way better than going to fight for something far away you don't know anything about."" Qutaiba, who joined the rebel Free Syrian Army as a student at the start of the revolution, asks those who would judge the Syrians who travelled to Azerbaijan to imagine what it is like being unable to afford milk or nappies for their children.""Those who see us as mercenaries, they don't see our poverty and our need. We would do anything to help our children. It's the worst thing to see your child needing milk and you can't provide it. In our place you too would make the same decision.""";E
UA;Nagorno-Karabakh: Turkey, Russia agree to set up joint ceasefire monitoring center;"Turkey will take part with Russia in the joint peace force that will be set up in the implementation, observation and inspection of the peace agreement.Turkey and Russia signed a memorandum of understanding on November 11 to set up in Azerbaijan a joint center to observe and inspect a peace agreement between Azerbaijan and Armenia, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said.He expressed hope for a similar outcome of an Ankara-Moscow cooperation for the ongoing conflict in Syria, Hurriyet Daily News reports.Turkey and Russia were in close contact in the last few days, with Erdogan and Russia's Vladimir Putin speaking over the phone two times since Sunday.The details of the center to be formed were discussed between the Turkish and Russian foreign and defense ministries.""Turkey will take part with Russia in the joint peace force that will be set up in the implementation, observation and inspection of the agreement.

On display were the Turkish drones that helped bolster Baku's forces.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan renewed his calls for a change of administration in Armenia as he celebrated Azerbaijan's military victory against the country.Erdogan attended a military parade in Baku that saluted Azerbaijan's victory in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, that claimed more than 5,000 lives.He called for new leadership in Armenia, and said that it could join a regional cooperation with Azerbaijan if it took certain steps. He also raised the possibility of reopening the border between Turkey and Armenia.Turkey provided critical diplomatic and military backing to Azerbaijan in the conflict over the Armenian-majority enclave, reportedly including redeploying Turkish mercenaries from Syria to bolster Baku's army.Under a Moscow-backed agreement, Armenia ceded control over some of the areas it lost during the fighting as well as seven adjacent districts it seized during a war in the 1990s. De jure, Nagorno-Karabakh is Azerbaijani territory, but the enclave had been controlled by Armenia since the 1990s conflict.""We wish for the Armenian people to rid itself of the burden of leaders who console them with the lies of the past and trap them into poverty,"" Erdogan said in Baku on Thursday.";A
TR;Turkey sends 36 military officers to man Russian-Turkish monitoring centre in Karabakh;Turkish army personnel assigned to the Russian-Turkish joint truce monitoring centre in the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region have left Turkey, Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said on Tuesday. “Our one general and 35 military officers will start their duty immediately,” state-run Anadolu agency cited Akar as saying at a year’s end meeting over video conference, once the construction is complete. Turkey and Russia agreed to establish a joint monitoring centre in Nagorno-Karabakh after Nov. 10 when Russia brokered a ceasefire between Azerbaijan and Armenia over the disputed region that is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan, but was governed by an ethnic Armenian majority. Conflict broke out in the region on Sept. 27, with both sides accusing each other of kick-starting one of the bloodiest bouts of clashes since the fall of the Soviet Union. Azerbaijan, with extensive support from Turkey, took over several territories formerly under Armenian control before the ceasefire was put in place. Earlier in the month, Azeri President Ilham Aliyev said the Turkish-Russian joint monitoring centre would be established in the city of Aghdam in Azerbaijan. In November, Turkey approved the deployment of troops on a peacekeeping mission in the region for one year. Some 2,000 troops will be sent to the region as part of the mission. Ankara and Baku pushed for the monitoring centre to be established in Nagorno-Karabakh, but the centre is set to remain on Azeri soil. On Nov. 25, Turkish and Russian Presidents Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Vladimir Putin signed a memorandum for the establishment of the centre.;A
UK;Turkey president says Armenia’s ‘occupation’ in disputed Nagorno-Karabakh is ending;"Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said that Armenia’s 28-year rule over Nagorno Karabakh is ending, following a ceasefire in the disputed territory on Tuesday. Mr Erdogan made the comments during a speech to Turkey’s parliament on Wednesday, the day after Russian peacekeepers were sent to the enclave after the conclusion of a six-week war between Armenian and Azeri forces. Fierce fighting broke between the two countries at the end of September over Nagorno Karabakh, with Turkey providing military assistance to Azerbaijan. In the intervening weeks, Azeri troops reclaimed swathes of the region - including the prized city of Shusha - that it had lost to Armenia in a war almost three decades ago. Now that hostilities between Yerevan and Baku have ceased, Turkey and Russia will jointly monitor the ceasefire in the territory, according to Mr Erdogan. The Turkish president’s words about the end of Armenia’s “occupation” on Wednesday echoed those made by his foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu at a press conference the previous day. Mr Cavusoglu hailed the ceasefire deal as a “great success and victory for Azerbaijan”, adding that that lands “under occupation for 30 years are being liberated”.  Ilham Aliyev, the president of Azerbaijan, marked the occasion by tweeting that the signing of the deal was “a historic day”.  “An end is being put to the Armenia-Azerbaijan Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. For our people, these days are the happiest ones. And I am also happy to deliver this pleasant news to my people,"" he added.  While Azeris celebrated, thousands of people in Armenia on Wednesday demanded the resignation of their prime minister Nikol Pashinyan, who came to power in 2018 in a popular uprising. Some of them, including a leading opposition figure, were arrested.  This comes the day after some Armenian protesters stormed the county’s parliament to protest against the ceasefire deal.  Earlier this week, Mr Pashinyan wrote on Facebook that the decision to sign the agreement was “hard” and “painful” but was based on military considerations and expert advice.  On Tuesday, he admitted that the result of the conflict was a “big failure and disaster” for his country. Although an exact death toll is not known, Russia estimated in October that almost 5,000 people had died as a result of fighting over Nagorno Karabakh, including nearly 150 civilians on both sides.  While Azerbaijan has not released casualty figures, Armenia has said that more than 1,220 of its military personnel have been killed.  Before the most recently fighting, Nagorno Karabakh, which is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan, was fully controlled by ethnic Armenians.  As part of the ceasefire, Azerbaijan will keep the territory it gained, while Armenia while have to cede control of some other areas by 1 December. Almost 2,000 servicemen will be deployed to Nagorno Karabakh for peacekeeping operations, Russia’s defence ministry said.";A
UK;Two men beheaded in videos from Nagorno-Karabakh war identified;Two elderly men who were beheaded by Azerbaijani forces in videos widely shared on messaging apps have been identified, confirming two of the bloodiest atrocities of the recent war in Nagorno-Karabakh.The ethnic Armenian men were non-combatants, people in their respective villages said. Both were beheaded by men in the uniforms of the Azerbaijani armed forces. The short, gruesome videos of the killings are among the worst of a torrent of footage portraying abuse, torture and murder that has continued to emerge more than a month after a Russian-brokered ceasefire came into force. The villagers’ testimony in interviews with the Guardian corroborates identifications by a human rights ombudsman for the Armenian-backed local government and two prominent Armenian human rights lawyers preparing a criminal case relating to the murders.The Guardian also confirmed one of the victim’s identities with a relative, and reviewed a passport application photograph that strongly resembles the other victim. In videos posted online on 22 November and 3 December, men in uniforms consistent with those of the Azerbaijani military hold down and decapitate a man using a knife. One then places the severed head on a dead animal. “This is how we get revenge – by cutting off heads,” a voice says off camera. Two residents of the village of Madatashen, in Nagorno-Karabakh, identified the victim as Genadi Petrosyan, 69, who had moved to the village in the late 1980s from the city of Sumgait, in Azerbaijan.Gayane Petrosyan (no relation), the head of the local school, lived directly across from Petrosyan’s modest, two-room house. She said his father had helped install the village’s electrical system, and he had shown her pictures of a son who had moved to Russia with his ex-wife. She said of one of the videos: “I could clearly see his face and I could recognise that it was him.” The Guardian has also seen a photograph of Petrosyan that closely resembles the victim in the video. Genadi Petrosyan, who lived alone, resisted leaving the village as Azerbaijani forces closed in. When a neighbour tried to drive him away, he got out of the car and walked home. Eduard Hayrapetyan, the village head, said he had known Petrosyan for more than three decades and considered him a close friend of his family’s. He received his last call from Petrosyan on the morning of 28 October, to say he had seen enemy forces in the village. Then, after weeks of silence, the video emerged. “I feel great sorrow that I took him away from the village and then he came back and this happened,” Hayrapetyan said. “I just can’t find my place.” Artak Beglaryan, a human rights ombudsman for the local Armenian-backed government, said Petrosyan had been identified by combing 35 missing persons reports for the region and then contacting acquaintances, who confirmed his identity. He called for greater efforts by the international community to investigate war crimes from the conflict. “Western countries have kept silent and they haven’t taken practical steps,” he said. “They have the duties and levers to speak about this … we don’t see any results, we don’t see any process from them.” Siranush Sahakyan, a human rights lawyer, also confirmed Petrosyan’s identity and said she and a colleague, Artak Zeynalyan, had prepared a criminal investigation into the murder. “Emotionally, it is hard to watch the videos. From a professional perspective, it can be very useful evidence,” Sahakyan said, cautioning that they had to carefully vet videos to make sure they were not faked. Amnesty International has called on Armenia and Azerbaijan to investigate videos of the decapitations and desecrations of corpses. The organisation has used digital verification techniques to authenticate the footage reviewed in this article, as well as footage of the murder of an Azerbaijani border guard who had his throat cut. Other videos show soldiers desecrating the bodies of enemy fighters. While both sides have been implicated, online channels are increasingly dominated by videos of Armenian soldiers and civilians being abused by advancing Azerbaijani troops. New revelations of torture and abuse mean that for many the violence continues even long after the war was halted. “Armenians and Azerbaijanis are watching those videos day in and day out, and every day there is a new video which is sending a new wave of assault on the public and public sensibilities,” said Tanya Lokshina, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, which prepared a painstaking report on abuses against Armenian prisoners of war, released early this month. “That trauma also results in increased levels of hatred. Even now when the active stage of the fighting is over.” Some of the most gruesome and widely watched videos have also been some of the most difficult to confirm. A video posted on a Telegram channel on 7 December showed two soldiers in uniforms consistent with the Azerbaijani military pinning down an elderly man near a tree. Another soldier passes a knife to one of the attackers, who begins slicing at the victim’s neck. The victim’s head begins to separate from the neck before the video ends. Three residents of the village of Azokh identified the victim in this video as Yuri Asryan, a reclusive 82-year-old who had refused to leave the village on 20 October as Azerbaijani forces approached. “He didn’t communicate with others very much. He just refused to leave,” said Georgi Avesyan, the longtime head of the village until 2019 and one of the people who identified Asryan. He said it was possible Asryan did not fully understand what was happening. Azerbaijani forces entered the village days later and it has remained under Baku’s control under the ceasefire agreement signed on 9 November. There was no news of Asryan’s fate until a 29-second video appeared last week on social networks, including Telegram channels that traffic in gory footage from the conflict. Araik Azumanyan, the current head of the village, said: “I received calls from many people from the village, and even people who had moved from the village to Armenia many years ago saying it looked like [Asryan] in the video.” A third villager who recognised Asryan said: “I felt terrible after watching it, my blood pressure was high, I couldn’t compose myself for a week after seeing that.” Beglaryan, the human rights ombudsman, and Sahakyan, the human rights lawyer, also confirmed Asryan’s identity. His closest relative, an elderly sister who occasionally visited him, knows that Asryan has died but has not seen the video. Asryan’s niece also confirmed to the Guardian that it was him in the video. Azerbaijan’s general prosecutor last month publicly launched an investigation into war crimes by both Baku and Yerevan. On Monday it made its first arrests, detaining two Azerbaijani soldiers for defiling the bodies of dead Armenian troops and two for destroying graves. It has not publicly opened any criminal cases into beheadings. There are hundreds more videos of abuses online. Sahakyan said she and a colleague were pursuing 75 cases of captive Armenian soldiers and civilians in the European court of human rights, including 35 that included video evidence. On Monday evening, the two government conducted a mass prisoner exchange, media in both countries reported. In one video, a villager named Kamo Manasyan is kicked and beaten as blood streams from his right eye. “How many more of you are here,” his interrogator yells in heavily accented Russian, aiming a rifle at Manasyan’s head. “Shoot me if you want,” Manasyan replies. The man hits him with the rifle instead. “It was hard to watch this video with this cruelty,” said Gagik, his nephew, in a video call. “I think they just want to show their success in this war and to humiliate Armenians, to show that they won.” Manasyan’s sister, Nora, cannot bear to watch the video. “I want the prisoners of war to come back as soon as possible,” she said, crying. “I want peace.” Asked for comment on allegations of human rights abuses during the war, a spokesman for the Council of Europe’s Commissioner on Human Rights said: “At this stage we can only say that the Commissioner has received videos and other material alleging human rights violations. Before expressing herself publicly, she wants to carry out a mission in order to assess the situation in first person. She is planning a mission to the region soon.”;E
HU;UN chief extremely concerned over Nagorno-Karabakh conflict;Two religious organisations representing Hungary’s main churches have called for a peaceful resolution to the armed conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh.

UK;Nagorno-Karabakh: Villagers burn their homes ahead of peace deal;Villagers outside Nagorno-Karabakh set their homes on fire Saturday before fleeing to Armenia ahead of a weekend deadline that will see some disputed territory handed over to Azerbaijan as part of a peace agreement. Residents of the Kalbajar district in Azerbaijan, which has been controlled by Armenian separatists for decades, began a mass exodus this week after it was announced that Azerbaijan would regain control on Sunday. Fighting between the separatists backed by Armenian troops and the Azerbaijan army erupted over the breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region in late September and raged for six weeks. Armenia said Saturday that 2,317 of its fighters were killed in the clashes, an increase of nearly 1,000 deaths from its previous official toll. Azerbaijan has not revealed its military casualties. But the Russian president Vladimir Putin said on Friday the number killed in the conflict was higher than 4,000 and that tens of thousands of people had been forced to flee their homes. In the Kalbajar village of Charektar, on the border with the district of Martakert which will remain under Armenian control, at least six houses were on fire on Saturday morning, with thick plumes of smoke rising over the valley, according to an AFP journalist. “This is my house, I can’t leave it to the Turks,” as Azerbaijanis are often called by Armenians, one resident said as he threw burning wooden planks and rags soaked in gasoline into an empty house. “Everybody is going to burn down their house today ... we were given until midnight to leave,” he said. “We also moved our parents’ graves, the Azerbaijanis will take great pleasure in desecrating our graves. It’s unbearable.” On Friday at least 10 houses were burned in and around Charektar. Kalbajar was almost exclusively populated by ethnic Azerbaijanis before they were expelled by Armenians in a 1990s war between the two countries following the break up of the Soviet Union, and a majority of the homes being burned previously belonged to Azerbaijanis. Armenia’s government controversially subsidised the region’s settlement by ethnic Armenians. The ex-Soviet rivals agreed to end hostilities earlier this week after previous efforts by Russia, France and the United States to get a ceasefire fell through. A key part of the peace deal includes Armenia returning Kalbajar and the Aghdam district by 20 November, as well as the Lachin district by 1 December, all of which have been held by Armenians since the devastating 1990s war left 30,000 people dead. After weeks of intense fighting, the two sides will maintain positions in the territories they currently hold – a significant gain for Azerbaijan, which has reclaimed around 15 to 20% of its lost territory including the key town of Shusha. Russian peacekeepers began deploying to Nagorno-Karabakh on Wednesday as part of the terms of the accord and took control of a key transport artery connecting Armenia to the disputed territory. Russian military officials said the mission consisting of nearly 2,000 troops would put in place 16 observation posts in mountainous Nagorno-Karabakh and along the Lachin corridor. The Azerbaijani president Ilham Aliyev has accused Armenians of destroying “99% of the liberated territory” including hospitals, houses and monuments, adding that he wants Armenia to pay compensation. Meanwhile in Armenia, anger has been mounting over the prime minister Nikol Pashinyan’s decision to cede swathes of territory. The former head of Armenia’s national security service, Artur Vanetsyan, was arrested on Saturday on charges of plotting to kill Pashinyan and seize power. Vanetsyan’s lawyers described the arrest as a “shameful persecution of opponents”. Thousands of people converged on the streets of the capital Yerevan in demonstrations this week, while protesters stormed and ransacked government buildings, demanding Pashinyan’s resignation. On Saturday, crowds gathered on Yerevan’s Liberty Square, where they lit candles in memory of soldiers killed in the fighting. They then marched silently through the streets towards the Matenadaran museum of ancient manuscripts where priests held a requiem service.;E

Embarking on adventurism for aspirations beyond its own capacity reveals Armenia’s failure of judgement and constitutes the biggest obstacle to peace and stability in our region.We hope that Armenia’s effort to cover up its own aggression will not be accepted by the international community in any way.Turkey will continue, with all its capacity, to stand by Azerbaijan in its struggle to protect its territorial integrity.;A

UK;What and where is Nagorno-Karabakh? The Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict explained;What and where is Nagorno-Karabakh? Nagorno-Karabakh is a disputed, Armenian-controlled breakaway region inside internationally recognised Azerbaijan. The two former Soviet states have been locked in conflict over the territory for the last four decades. A bloody war in the early 1990s saw an estimated 20,000 people killed, and a million displaced. It was ended by an uneasy ceasefire in 1994, which was never followed by a truce.   What are the origins of the conflict? The modern conflict dates back to Armenian nationalist movements in the Soviet Union during the early 1980s. However, the key date is February 1988, when the ethnic Armenian majority in Nagorno-Karabakh requested that the territory be transferred from Soviet Azerbaijan to Soviet Armenia. With the USSR crumbling around him, Mikhail Gorbachev was unable to stop a process that eventually led to a disputed independence referendum, territorial claims, and full-scale war.   Who backs whom? The separatist Nagorno-Karabakh government is backed by Armenia. As a member of Moscow’s Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), Armenia enjoys the formal military backing of Russia, but that does not extend to the disputed territories. Russia, meanwhile, has shown no desire to choose a side — and has even supplied arms to both. In terms of the other neighbouring regional powers, Iran is officially neutral, but Turkey is providing weapons and, reportedly, mercenary soldiers to its ally Azerbaijan.  Why are things worse this time? The fighting, which started on Sunday morning, is the most serious since the ceasefire agreement was signed in 1994. Both sides have employed heavy weapons systems and aviation in and around civilian populations. The death toll is almost certainly higher than the 200 that was recorded during the last major flare-up in 2016. But the biggest new worry is the immediate international context. The United States, preoccupied by November's presidential elections, is conspicuous by its absence. Russia has shown little desire to intervene on behalf of either side. Only Turkey is playing an active role – and in a belligerent capacity.   What could happen? There are several possible outcomes, but none includes an immediate ceasefire or peace agreement. It is hard to see how either side would renounce their claims to territory in Nagorno-Karabakh. Both Armenia and Azerbaijan see the region as theirs – a source of historical identity and security – and the memories of war atrocities run deep. Yet there is no obvious prospect of military victory for either side. The richer Azerbaijan has a better-equipped army, supplemented with new drone hardware from Israel and Turkey. Armenian forces are considered to be better organised, however, with the advantage of defensive positions. A good prognosis would see battles focused on small pockets of land and ended within a week;N
ES;Upper Karabakh, a conflict of more than 30 years that threatens to escalate into a regional war;"When he saw the extent of the attacks against Stepanakert and other areas of Upper Karabakh, Hovig Asmaryan decided to send his three children to spend time with their relatives in Yerevan. Asmaryan, an ethnic Armenian Syrian from Aleppo, arrived in Upper Karabakh in late 2012, fleeing the war in Syria. In the mountainous enclave, on soil internationally recognized as Azerbaijani but controlled by Armenia, he bought a farm and recently opened a Syrian and Mediterranean restaurant. It was not bad for him, account by video call from Stepanakert. The region, ravaged in the Yerevan-Baku war for control of the enclave in the early 1990s, had been revitalized and modernized thanks, in large part, to donations from the large Armenian diaspora. Today, the scars of the conflict are once again visible on the buildings and streets of the region, and Asmaryan, 50, is experiencing another war.The Upper Karabakh - or Nagorno Karabakh - in the South Caucasus, with 150,000 inhabitants (the vast majority of Armenian ethnicity) and which has claims of self-determination, has experienced the most serious clashes between Armenia and Azerbaijan since 1994, the date on which a ceasefire was signed and has been continuously broken. A war now open in a heavily militarized region that can lead to a spiral that fully involves regional powers: Russia, due to its influence in the region and its defense agreement with Armenia, and Turkey, with an increasingly expansive appetite and imperialism, which supports Azerbaijan and is testing Moscow's influence in the South Caucasus.The recent clashes between the two former Soviet republics, the latest chapter in a latent conflict lasting three decades, are of increasing concern to the international community. War may further destabilize an area that acts as an important energy corridor for global markets: very close to the front line is a gas pipeline opened last year that runs through Turkey, aimed at easing Europe's dependence on imports. of Russian gas.On Saturday, after more than 10 hours of negotiation sponsored by Moscow, Armenia and Azerbaijan, they announced a ceasefire aimed at exchanging prisoners and recovering the dead, under the mediation of the Red Cross. A truce that, however, has already been broken a dozen times. Yerevan and Baku accuse each other of attacks against civilians. Armenia reports 20 civilians and 525 soldiers killed. Azerbaijan, which has not disclosed its military casualties, claims that more than 41 civilians have been killed and 205 injured since the start of hostilities on September 27.Lika Zakaryan says that since practically since then she has lived in a small bomb shelter with three other people in Stepanakert. ""My house was hit by one of the attacks and we no longer have electricity or gas there and the living room is missing a wall,"" says the 26-year-old, who was born in Upper Karabakh after the war in the early 1990s. lasted six years. Zakaryan, who studied Sociology but who in recent months worked for an information website about the region, explains on Skype that her 24-year-old brother, her boyfriend and a good number of his friends are at the front.Despite the ceasefire and as talks on how to develop it continue in Moscow, the leader of the region, Arayik Harutyunyan, has announced that he is meeting with veterans of the war of the n + oventa so that they also get involved in the battle. ""The situation is fatal,"" he wrote on Facebook. The authorities in Upper Karabakh accuse Azerbaijan of initiating the confrontation and attacking civilian targets. ""Azerbaijan has deliberately attacked more than 120 civilian settlements,"" insists local politician David Babayan from his office in Stepanakert by video call. In addition to residential buildings, Babayan talks about bridges, water and electricity installations, and also communications. On Thursday, two attacks destroyed much of Shusha Cathedral and seriously wounded three Russian informants.Baku denies it and accuses Armenia of attacking a residential area in Ganja, the country's second city, after the signing of the ceasefire and at dawn. Azerbaijani authorities have reported nine civilians killed and 34 injured, according to a note from the Foreign Ministry. Media on the ground in Ganja, such as France 24 or the BBC, have broadcast images of the enormous damage caused in the area by what Baku identifies as a ballistic missile. ""If Armenia continues to attack civilian targets, Azerbaijan will be forced to take necessary measures against military targets,"" said presidential adviser Hikmey Hajiyev.Lawyer Tatev Asaryan was born in Upper Karabakh the day after the signing of the 1994 ceasefire between Baku and Yerevan, after the war that caused some 30,000 deaths and thousands of displaced people and for which a peace agreement was never signed. Through a precarious Internet connection and from one of the Stepanakert shelters, he assures that, despite the fact that normal life has practically stopped, families are making an effort so that children follow their classes in one way or another.The Red Cross, which has provided emergency medical supplies to hospitals and body bags to the Nagorno Karabakh forensic office, as explained in a note, also warns of the spread of the covid-19 pandemic among a refugee population in bunkers and with worse access to health facilities. Also of the arrival of the cold, says the head of human rights of Upper Karabakh, Artak Beglaryan. ""50% of the population have had to leave their homes, some to shelters within the region, others to Armenia,"" Beglaryan said by phone from Stepanakert. Like Yana Avanesyan, who left Upper Karabakh when an artillery attack hit her sister's house. ""It was not safe and we decided that it was better to go out to Yerevan than to stay in a shelter,"" says Avanesyan, a law professor at Stepanakert University who specializes in humanitarian law, by video call. She does not know when she will return.The latent confrontation for the mountainous enclave that several UN resolutions recognize as part of Azerbaijan began before Avanesyan was born, which has not yet reached thirty, and is the result of the conflicts inherited from the former USSR and its collapse, which combine territorial and ethnic tensions in a tumultuous South Caucasus. But this latest outburst is different. Not only because it comes at a time when both Armenia and Azerbaijan have much more sophisticated weapons, points out the expert in the area Thomas de Waal, who also highlights the intense information war on television and social networks: also because of the involvement of Turkey, which has offered its most direct support to its ally Azerbaijan in an area of ​​traditionally Russian influence, which adds another new and complex component. All of this increases the risk of the local conflict becoming regional. The one in Upper Karabakh would join the conflict in Libya and Syria, where Ankara and Moscow support rival sides.Armenia has a defense agreement with Russia, which supplies arms to Yerevan but also to Baku, which has also invested a large part of the money earned with oil in buying defense material also from other suppliers, such as Israeli and Turkish drones that, according to Russian military expert Pavel Felgenhauer, are giving you a comparative advantage. In addition, different reports from Armenian, French and Russian intelligence as well as the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights indicate that dozens of Syrian mercenaries have come to the front to fight for Azerbaijan but financed with Turkish money. Turkey denies it.Ankara's intervention and Baku's requests to participate in the negotiating table deeply scare Armenia and stimulate the memory of the persecution of Armenians by the Ottoman government in which more than 1.5 million died. A massacre recognized as genocide by a good number of countries. “It is very difficult to find a common language with the Turks, this is what history has taught us. But we are prepared to resist and fight to protect our people, ”remarks farmer and restaurateur Hovig Asmaryan.";E
AD;Escape from a Nagorno-Karabakh that bleeds for war;"When refugees are spoken of in Nagorno-Karabakh, it is usually done in feminine. Thousands of women are fleeing every day from villages near the battlefield, where Azerbaijan is targeting and bombing civilian locations day after day. The men, on the other hand, are in charge of grabbing the rifle and waiting in the trench. Adult men, but also young men who, in many cases, barely reach adulthood. The war between Armenia and Azerbaijan over this divided region - according to the map within the domains of Azerbaijan but with an Armenian majority - has not stopped and the conflict has been entrenched for days since the fighting began on September 27. .""They are very discouraged,"" a military official said quietly in Stepanakert, the capital of the unrecognized Artsakh republic, referring to his soldiers, who have suffered airstrikes from a homeless hole. A few days ago, a surgeon at the hospital in this city assured this journalist that he had never seen anything like it in his entire professional career and despite Nagorno-Karabakh having suffered two wars in the last 30 years. “People with mutilated limbs come to us,” he explained.Meanwhile, they, the refugees, have had to carry their children on their shoulders and go down to the Armenian capital, Yerevan, to escape the attacks. There, they wait for the phone to ring to hear the voice, for a few seconds, of their relatives at the front. ""We try to talk to them every day, but we don't even want to know where they are, just by hearing their voice we already know that they are alive and let them continue with their mission,"" says Neli, a school teacher who fled. from his village on September 27, when the first projectiles fell on Nagorno-Karabakh. But he smiles and is optimistic: ""At least here I teach them all the subjects and the neighborhood school will admit them right away.""From an abandoned restaurant in Abovyan, 15 kilometers from Yerevan, she and several women of all ages wait for the war to end. ""On the first day of the offensive we were left alone, all the men marched to the front. We decided to hide in a church, but they started bombing very close. The children kept crying, ""he laments. He also explains that they then went to Stepanakert by bus, but the artillery fell on them. It is not the only story that shows indiscriminate attacks on the civilian population.Nazani, 26, gives a similar testimony. ""I remember it was Sunday morning and bombs started falling. I took my two children and we hid in the woods because the artillery hit civilian locations. Her husband is also at the front and she takes care of the creatures. ""It was impossible to spend the day locked in shelters,"" he says, referring to the state in which they had to live in Stepanakert to protect themselves from attacks. So he joined the convoy of cars made up of volunteers who evacuate dozens of people every day who want to get to Yerevan and other cities in the country.And it is this same volunteering that predominates right now in the lands of Nagorno-Karabakh: ""Here the prices have not been inflated by the war, they have disappeared, everything is free,"" said Hobit, one of the few men who is not at the front. ""I'm too old, they didn't want me, but in 2016 I did. Now I have decided to help in the best way I can: distributing food to all the shelters in Stepanakert ”.No agreementRussia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday that the Kremlin wants to place Russian military observers on the Nagorno-Karabakh battle front to ensure a fully utopian ceasefire agreed on paper a week ago. . Russia argues that the final decision rests with Armenia and Azerbaijan. And so far, neither side has respected it and civilian casualties have continued to rise. Both parties are accused of breaching the agreement.The figures are staggering: the death toll on the Armenian side is more than 500, although corpses abandoned at the front due to unstoppable fighting have not yet been collected. Therefore, the number of fallen Armenian soldiers - it is speculated - would be much higher. Azerbaijan, on the other hand, does not give figures for military casualties.";E
